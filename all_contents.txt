# The Rise and Fall of Abacus Rationale
September 18th, 2024
by *Pepe Hernandez*

Abacus Rationale started small. It started from a software entrepreneurship effort in the eighties. A teacher developed a payroll system for their university, which was a success. He continued his career at the university as a teacher and obtained great credibility for his achievements, but he wanted to be an entrepreneur.

The entrepreneur wanted to create a company and was associated with a finance and accounting specialist, and both made the Abacus Rationale. Together, they envisioned the first company service:  Internet Subscription. They offered a product different from the one provided by the telecommunications monopoly in Mexico. The users started to grow and grow. A pair of years later, the service had 10,000 active accounts. As a small company trying to diversify its services, it sold equipment and repaired computers. That was before the big companies started to offer high-band internet services. When the Mexican telecommunications market opened to competence, there was both a there and an opportunity. New entrance companies began to buy small companies' user base. Abacus Rationale saw that as an opportunity and sold theirs to one of the big three internet providers. There were two options: trading and getting some money or slowly losing their user base. Abacus Rationale sold, and rethink the road ahead.

That was a good move. It allowed Abacus Rationale to make good money and specialize in selling equipment and IT infrastructure solutions to its main customer, the Local Government. 

The company went from software development to subscription services and then to retail and IT solution provider in the middle of the 1990s. 

During that period, Abacus Rationale hired several engineers and invested heavily in them. The company paid the engineers well, and they received annual bonuses. They also received a very flexible day job schedule. They could work anywhere. The entrepreneur adapted to new times. 

The physical office was a house of three levels: the medium, the basement, and the upper. The rooms of the house were offices for the different teams: accounting, selling, engineering, and monitoring. They had a meeting room, a reception, and a hall with several desks. The Engineers guys were good at their craftmanship. They became better due to the policy established by the entrepreneur. They had the time to study all the equipment and simulations to learn how to configure the different appliances. The agreements with the big TelCo providers had the benefit of asking for new equipment and virtual training for "free." Engineers had at hand routers, phones, switches, virtual simulators, and several artifacts to make experiments. When the engineers were confident, they asked management for money to pay for a certification exam. The company didn't invest in training classes, workshops, or courses, but Abacus Rationale made a big difference—the company had more certifications than all the local companies. On average, every engineer had more than eight certificates. 

The engineers' experience, validated by their official achievement certificates, was a strong differentiator when the government or other clients asked for service from local companies. The infrastructure solutions and the quality of their structured cable, fiber, routing, IP telephony, LAN configuration, and LAN security were of higher quality.

The entrepreneur was a native seller. He makes the right deals. The company always had Projects.

They also grew in personnel slowly. Just enough to continue their sustained growth.

The oil bonus of 2000 provided many resources from the Mexican local government until 2010. The property allowed investment in the modernization of government services and facilities. From 2008 to 2010, a big budget was allocated to developing government facilities, infrastructure, and digital services. Abacus Rationale had the relational capital, the knowledge capital, and the financial support to take a good piece of cake. They made it. 

Abacus Rationale was a certified partner of the Big Guys. Other companies with financial support and knowledge made their offers but didn't know the context very well. Abacus Rationale knew what government agencies needed. Abacus rationale knew the context well on their own and their insiders on the government. 

Abacus had the muscle, experience, knowledge, backup, and relationships and had grown enough to be financially supported by the big telco communication equipment companies. 

That was good and prosperous times.

Abacus Rationale has created many good relationships with its clients due to its professional services and frequently because of its patients. Sometimes, the government doesn't pay as fast as the contractors need. 

In 2010, things started to change. There was a change of administration. New times, in context, require different policies. The federal government began limiting equipment length and changing the contract services policy. Selling equipment was one of their primary sources of income. Instead of buying computers, leasing was an option for the government to have good computers.

But there were other opportunities to take advantage of. The federal and local governments continued believing in innovation and the digitalization of services. They also supported entrepreneurship and invested in people's digitalization culture.

Abacus Rationale had prestige and was open to new ideas. 

Federal government funds were available for companies, organizations, academia, and governments to support innovations and entrepreneurship projects. That was the case for InnovaPYME and ProSoft (federal programs created with this aim). 

Before 2010, other actors arrived: Research Centers, Top Public Universities, a young wave of technopolitics, and new small companies that wanted to make a dent in the local universe and take advantage of all the existing funds. Both the InnovaPYME and ProSoft programs motivated collaboration between Academia and Private Companies. 

Abacus Rationale started collaborating with a research center specializing in software projects to create a spinoff in its successful IT service provider vein. In 2012, a small software company was made—in reality, it was a startup. The SW company was looking for a business model. The company was named Code Rationale, following its parent's Rational way of work.

The Research Center had grouped a very talented bunch of people, some coming from booming government pace, others from industry, and persistent entrepreneurs with previous startup adventures scars.

Abacus Rationale, in collaboration with the Research Center, created Code Rationale. The Research Center used all its expertise to hire and train the development team, which a proficient Architect and Developer led. The team developed transactional software using the best open-source tools, frameworks, and base language. They had a year to create four prototypes, and they did it—even though they were looking for a business model. 

After the first year, Abacus Rationale found a promising bet: Business Process Digitization Services. One year after the company's creation, Code Rationale started to offer another digitization service and a software house for transactional government systems. They also received funds from InnovaPYME and created both software and hardware to specialize in document digitization. 

At the same time, there were software development projects with other government organizations. Code Rational's team had to grow. They started with less than ten people. In three years, the developers' team was threepled. 

Meanwhile, the projects for Abacus Rationale started to slow down. Cloud Web Services were a precarious competence, but a real one, for physical sites. The government doesn't use Cloud Web Services at all today, but some of the big entities do. 

The local government promoted an Innovation Park where all innovative companies could create research centers. The Federal Government wants all Mexican states to have their innovation parks. The Local Government invited Innovative companies to join the effort. It was challenging to say no. The government was still the primary customer of Abacus Rationale. It was like a Trojan Horse. It was like a poisoned apple.

Abacus Rationale compromised its future to build the headquarters of its dreams. They did it; it was a big bet. The luxury building could be the company's presentation card. 

Then, the country's economic context changed dramatically. Local states started to need more resources. That was 2018. The New Federal Administration erased innovation funding programs and other funds for specific purposes; the Federal Government erased municipal development funds, mining funds, and disaster funds. All were concentrated at the federal government level to invest in social programs for younger and third-age people. What innovation companies did some companies take advantage of to grow and disappear in just one year?

Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world and the economy. 

In 2021, there was a radical change in the Local Government from a different party.

Abacus Rationale started to starving. No projects, no money. Depending mostly on one client made Abacus Rationale fragile. The little brother of Abacus was an instrument for selling. 

From 2012 to 2018, Code Rationale was Net Profitable. But the pressure was too high. Code Rationale received the work and the problems, but it didn't receive the benefits of the Abacus projects obtained thanks to the Code Rationale sacrifice.

In 2018, Code Rationale gave up. 

When Toyota faced the challenge of the global crisis in 2008 and then the recall crisis in 2010, it was prepared. It had a global market, the TPS, the culture, the people, and leadership. It took advantage and refocused on quality again. Abacus Rationale could have had the same opportunity.

When 3M faced a mining crisis, it gave the employees time to look for new ways to make money. That allowed the creation of different projects, among them the Post-it. Abacus Rationale could have the time.

But Abucus Rational had no money. 

They needed money but a new luxury headquarters in the Innovation Park. 

After investing in the new headquarters building, all the money was used to pay, so the annual bonus disappeared completely. That started in 2018.

The company, which had evolved resiliently from software to a subscription service, IT infrastructure solutions, and business process outsourcing, lost its direction. 

Entrepreneurs thought that a building could be the prestige they needed to go further. 

Without new projects, an important part of the personnel payroll disappeared. The personnel had to look for new projects. The few projects were assigned to other providers. Each new Government administration has its preferences, under the legal boundaries. That was the case.

The engineers left the ship one by one until the last proficient engineer left the dream.

The entrepreneurs who invest "a lot" of money in the certifications ask them to stay—to hold on. But more mature people need money to cover their normal expenses (household, food, tuition, etc.). They look for new jobs, and they find them. 

All the certified engineers now work for more prominent companies. Their experience, knowledge, and certificates went with them in their hearts, brains, and bodies. 

The entrepreneur, his finance associate, and a pair of clerical people stay in the company, and they rent offices in the building they thought would once be the leverage point for the company's growth. 

What could have happened if the entrepreneur hadn't invested in the building and could have done what Toyota or 3M did to overcome the difficult times? As Eliyahu Goldratt, the creator of the Theory of Constraints, said: You have to take advantage of any crisis. Why did they not make a decision that made them a little bit antifragile or at least gave them more options for the future? We'll never know. The "would" does not exist.

                  **Architecture-Oriented Programming in Eiffel**
	Applying systems architecture (i.e. between servers) at level of programs (i.e. between functions)


A Conjecture
===============================================================================

Architecture Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that increases reusability and modularity of Object Oriented Languages.
By identifying patterns found at the *architecture level* of *systems* and shrinking them at the *code level* of *programs*.
The advanced features of Eiffel, such as Genericity, Aliasing, and Design by Contract, make it an ideal environment to implement AOP.
And it would result in smaller code with more reusability in Eiffel programs.

Background
================================================================================

Architecture Oriented Programming (AOP) is the name given by Weiher and Hirschfeld to their ideas in developing the Objective Smalltalk language.
The main idea is delightfully simple:

>  What if we took inspiration from the architecture of big systems,
>    and shrink the techniques to organize a single program.

(Weiher, 2020 a)  identified the first patterns and also made a summary in the YouTube presentation: "Can programmers escape the gentle tyranny of call return" (Weiher, 2020 b)
Also, each pattern was published independently. As is shown in table [Summary]:

| Inspired by                      | AOP Proposes                          | One Sentence Summary                                                                                                                                                                                 | Examples                                                                                                                                                     | Reference                                                                                                     |

[Table [Summary]: Summary of AOP Patterns and their publication]

Uncertainties (Known-Unknowns)
================================================================================

In his conference, Marcel P. Weiher says that the comments for Unicon made it decide to create a new language (Objective Smalltalk) instead of a library for an existing language.
And on this project, I'm doing exactly that: creating a library, not a new language.
So it might be a bad idea.
However, the advanced tools of Eiffel make this a better approach in this language.

My plan
================================================================================

To get the implementation of AOP in the Eiffel, I intend to:

First
-----------

Write a complete design by contract specification of the architecture patterns identified.
This will require also the description of frame rules.
Probably using "model queries" (Polikarpova et al. 2012)

Second
-----------

I'll make several implementations.
Here, I'll experiment.
Where I'd ask a set of 5 developers to each
develop their storage combinator and polymorphic identifier.
Then, I will try to compose all of them.
And survey the developers to see how they feel about the patterns' specification and composability.

Third
-----------

To test that the code based on AOP is more reusable than the current call return style. I will reimplement a project in Eiffel (like the Nino Webserver).
On AOP and measure using Avontis & Mingis 93 "Metrics from Object-Oriented Design."


Future work (avenues to explore)
=============================================================================

It seems pretentious to talk about "future work" when discussing a proposal for a future project.
But, assuming that I can achieve the goals in the plan. I.e., a specification and implementation for AOP in Eiffel.
What other avenues will open for exploration?
At the moment, I can imagine the following:

Shrink other architectural patterns at the level of programs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weiher has currently only identified six architectural patterns and shrunk them to the level of programs.
So, a natural progression of this work would be to specify and code even more patterns.

For example, how would a queue-based architecture (like Rabbit MQ) look at the program level? Something like Erlang with OTP?

How would an Event Sourcing architecture look at the program level?
Could we reuse the agent and pub/sub mechanism in GUI Eiffel for other object communication, not only GUI?
Reusing it as the main means of communication among objects.


Given a specification, can ChatGPT program an implementation?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we follow the headlines, there are two ways of thinking about programming and Large Language Models (LLMs like chatgpt).
Either:

> Programming is dead, and ChatGPT killed it.

or

> ChatGPT and their inherent hallucinations make it irrelevant to programming.

However, I think Design by Contract (DBC) opens an avenue for collaboration between the two approaches.
In this collaboration, humans would write a specification in DBC  with the appropriate frame rules.
Then ChatGPT would try to code to the specification.

So it would be fascinating to see if, given a spec for AOP, we could get ChatGPT to implement it.

Others
-----------------------------
While developing this work, other avenues of growth will become more apparent.


Expected Contributions
================================================================================

As a result of this work, I expect to deliver the following work products.

- Write a design by contract specification of the AOP patterns documented by Weiher.
- Program an Eiffel implementation of said patterns.
- Share the specification and its benefits with the academic and development communities so they can use AOP.

An independent research lab exploring the future of tools for thought.
================================================================

We envision a new computer that amplifies human intelligence. A system
that helps you think more clearly, collaborate more effectively, and is
available anywhere and anytime. Though the specifics of our work
continue to evolve, everything we do is in pursuit of this vision.

Research Tracks
---------------------------------------------------------------

Our research spans a wide variety of domains from theoretical computer
science to practical user experiences. We currently have three primary
research themes.

### Malleable Software

Designing software environments where people can customize tools in the
moment to meet their unique needs.

### Programmable Ink

Discovering a dynamic medium for sketching ideas where adding behaviors
and interaction is as natural as applying ink to paper.

### [Local-First](/local-first)

Exploring software architecture that returns data to users and enables
collaboration in every tool.


Our Writing
==============================================================

This are the innovations that have been ocupaying our minds lately
