                  **In-program RESOURCES implementation in Eiffel **

What would happen, if we took the Universal Access Principle (UAP) and the RESTful architecture seriously?
If every piece of data in our program had a URL and every collection responded to a REST verbs.

Introduction
===========================================================================

UAP coined by Bertrand Meyer, means that there should be no difference between the way we invoke a computation (in java call a 'method')
And the way we address value. (in java read a 'field').
Polymorphic Identifiers is the name given by Marcel P. Weiher, to the idea of applying the UAP to every piece of data a program can need.
Inspired by the fact that in the internet, everything has an address (URL: Uniform Resource Locator) or a name (URI: Uniform Resource Identifier).
Weiher concluded that the exact same mechanism could be use to address any piece of data used by a single program.
He implemented PI's first as a library and then as foundational concept of his programming language Objective-Smalltalk.

In this paper we explain the implementation of RESTFUL an Eiffel package that implements the ideas of PI's
Taking advantage of Eiffel's unique capabilities, such as Design-by-Contract, Multiple Inheritance and Once Classes.

Motivating Example
==============================================================================

Let's start with a simple challenge:
We want to read the code Repositories an Organization has on GitHub.
So we must get the json in the URL https://api.github.com/orgs/dotnet/repos
Uppercase the name of the project
And save them, Pretty Printed in a local file.

The NuShell Implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NuShell is a Unix shell like Bash or Fish with a heavy focus on data processing.

``` NuShell
HTTP get https://api.github.com/orgs/dotnet/repos
    | from json
    | each { |repo| $repo | set name ($repo.name | str to-upper) }
    | to json --pretty > dotnet_repos_uppercase.json

```

As you can see the code is very expressive
it practically reads like the problem statement.

Eiffel Implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inspired by this example code by [JLVilla](https://github.com/EiffelNETCore/examples/blob/main/sdk/console/api_client_newtonsoft/application.e)
Our code will look like this:

```Eiffel
note
    description: "Project root class"
    EIS: "name=HTTP Request", "src=https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/csharp/getting-started/console-webapiclient", "protocol=uri"

            l_request: HTTP_REQUEST_MESSAGE
            l_response: HTTP_RESPONSE_MESSAGE
            l_serializer: JSON_SERIALIZER
            l_repo: REPOSITORY
            l_arr: ARRAY_LIST
            l_json_writer: JSON_TEXT_WRITER
            l_file: SYSTEM_FILE
            i: INTEGER
        do
            create client.make

            -- Send request and get response
            create l_request.make_from_method_and_request_uri ({HTTP_METHOD}.get, "")
            client.set_base_address ("https://api.github.com/orgs/dotnet/repos")
            l_response := client.send_http_request_message (l_request)

            -- Deserialize the response
            create l_serializer.make
            create l_arr.make
            l_serializer.deserialize_json (l_response.content.read_as_stream, l_arr)

            -- Uppercase repo names and collect them in a list
            across l_arr as repo_item loop
                l_repo := {REPOSITORY}.from_json (repo_item.item.to_string)
                l_repo.set_name (l_repo.name.upper)
                l_arr.force (l_repo)
            end

            -- Write JSON to file
            create l_file.make ("dotnet_repos_uppercase.json")
            create l_json_writer.make
            l_file.append_text (l_arr.to_json)
        end
end
```

Observe how many instructions are spent setting up the configuration to load the data, transform it and the store it again.

And also observe that the line count, is a lot more than the "ideal" version set by NuShell.

Now this problems are not specific to Eiffel.
Any program with Static typing would have a high Line Count.
This is due to the static nature of typing and the fact that json was born to be `evaluate` by a JavaScript interpreter.
In this code listing we don't even, show the `{REPOSITORY}` class with the `from_json` converting feature.

But even dynamically typed languages have the similar problems


JavaScript Implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```node
#!/usr/bin/env node

// uppercase_dotnet_repos.js

import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

async function main() {
  const token = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;          // optional GitHub token for higher rate limits
  const headers = {
    'Accept': 'application/vnd.github+json',
    ...(token && { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` })
  };

  // 1. Fetch repos
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/orgs/dotnet/repos', { headers });
  if (!res.ok) {
    console.error(`GitHub API error: ${res.status} ${res.statusText}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  const repos = await res.json();

  // 2. Upper-case the `name` field
  const updated = repos.map(repo => ({
    ...repo,
    name: repo.name.toUpperCase()
  }));

  // 3. Write out pretty-printed JSON
  const outPath = 'dotnet_repos_uppercase.json';
  await writeFile(outPath, JSON.stringify(updated, null, 2), 'utf8');
  console.log(`✅ Wrote ${updated.length} repos to ${outPath}`);
}

main().catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Summary of Implementations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the table 1 we can see how all implementations are a lot more verbose than
the one in NuShell and only the Eiffel Implementation, provides the safety warranties
of a Statically typed language.

In this paper we will develop RESTFUL Eiffel
a cluster of Eiffel classes that will help us get closer to the "ideal"


Background
===============================================================================

RESTful Architecture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intuitively a every-time you open a web-browser like Chrome or Firefox,
and you read a web page like Wikipedia you are using a RESTful architecture.

The browser is a user-agent.
connecting to Server (Wikipedia.com).
Through a resource identification (URI): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)
Using the GET (HTTP verb).
And your content is delivered to you in a Representation (i.e. XHTML).
But you could also get other representations. like a json formatted text of the same information.



The REST architecture was defined by Roy Fielding in his PhD Thesis.
And later formalized with TLA+ by (name of the paper).
In particular Fielding has said that many APIs that claim to be RESTful aren't.

So what is a RESTFUL API? A RESTful system is one that satisfy the following constraints.


### REST Constraints

 RESTful systems are defined by six constraints that, distinguish them from other architectural styles:

Client–Server
:   Separates user interface (clients) from data storage (servers), allowing each to evolve independently.
    Clients interact with origin servers (or their caches) via a uniform interface.

Stateless
:  Every request carries all the information needed for processing; servers do not retain client session state.
   All application state is kept on the client side (including caches).

Cacheable
:  Responses are explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable.
   Caching by clients and intermediaries reduces load and improves performance by reusing prior responses.

Layered System
:  Clients don’t know (and needn’t know) whether they’re talking directly to the origin server or to an intermediary (proxy, gateway, etc.).
   Intermediaries can provide shared caches, load balancing, and security enforcement without altering client–server interactions.

Uniform Interface (the central REST principle)
:  Enforced via four sub-constraints:
   * **Resource Identification:** Each resource is uniquely identified (e.g., by a URI).
   * **Manipulation via Representations:** Clients change resource state by exchanging representations.
   * **Self-Descriptive Messages:** Every message carries enough metadata (resource IDs, representation format, hypermedia links) to be understood in isolation.
   * **HATEOAS:** Clients discover available actions dynamically through hypermedia controls provided in responses.

Code-On-Demand (optional)
:  Servers can extend client functionality by sending executable code (applets, scripts), which clients download and run.

Systems that satisfy all mandatory constraints (1–5) — and optionally 6 — are deemed RESTful.


### REST Actors

Based on the previous Constraints we Can identify the following actors:

Here’s the expanded set of REST actors, now including Proxies, Gateways, and Caches as distinct elements:

:   Resources
    Named abstractions of information (identified by URIs) on which operations are performed.
    According to Roy Fielding in his dissertation "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures" (2000), a resource in REST (Representational State Transfer) is defined as:
    > “Any information that can be named.”

    He elaborates that:
        A resource is an abstraction of some piece of information or service.
        It is identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
        The actual content or representation of the resource (like HTML, JSON, XML, etc.) is separate from the resource itself.
        A resource may have multiple representations, and those are transferred to clients through the REST interface (usually over HTTP).

User Agents
:   Client-side processes (plus their client connectors) that initiate resource requests and receive responses.

Origin Servers
:   Server-side processes (plus their server connectors) responsible for hosting and managing resource representations and handling modification requests.

Proxies
:   Client-selected intermediaries that forward requests to origin servers (or other intermediaries), optionally transforming or filtering messages for purposes like security, protocol translation, or request aggregation.

Gateways
:   Network- or server-selected intermediaries that bridge between different systems or protocols—e.g., translating between REST and legacy APIs—without the client needing to know about the back-end topology.

Caches
:   Storage actors that hold previously retrieved, cacheable responses; they can reside within User Agents, Proxies, Gateways, or Origin Servers to answer identical future requests without recontacting the origin server.


* **Connectors**
  The uniform-interface links—clients, servers, caches, resolvers, tunnels—through which all components communicate, hiding implementation details and ensuring consistent, stateless interactions.

Together, User Agents use client connectors to request or manipulate Resources managed by Origin Servers, optionally via Proxies or Gateways, with Caches improving efficiency—all over the same Uniform Interface.


### REST Verbs


| Method  | Definition                                                       | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable                  |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|:----:|:----------:|:---------------------------|
| GET     | Requests a resource representation; retrieves data only.         | Yes  | Yes        | Yes                        |
| HEAD    | Same as GET but without a response body.                         | Yes  | Yes        | Yes                        |
| POST    | Submits data; may change state or cause side effects.            | No   | No         | Conditional [^conditional] |
| PUT     | Replaces the resource’s representation with the request content. | No   | Yes        | No                         |
| DELETE  | Removes the specified resource.                                  | No   | Yes        | No                         |
| CONNECT | Opens a tunnel to the target resource.                           | No   | No         | No                         |
| OPTIONS | Lists available communication options for the resource.          | Yes  | Yes        | No                         |
| TRACE   | Performs a loop-back diagnostic test.                            | Yes  | Yes        | No                         |
| PATCH   | Applies partial modifications to a resource.                     | No   | No         | Conditional [^conditional] |

Eiffel's Features that match RESTful interface
===============================================

Design by Contract
------------------------------------------------
a pre-condition violation is equivalent to an Error 404 Not found
a post-condition violation is equivalent to an Error 500 Internal Server Error

Once classes
------------------------------------------------
Are equivalent to a resource,
since a resource is uniquely know by an identifier
it means resources behave like Singleton pattern
and once classes are perfect to represent resources.

Multiple Inheritance
-------------------------------------------------
A server component is-a Resource that also responds to the REST Verbs.

deferred classes (in java abstract classes)
-------------------------------------------------
A deferred class help us define clearly what are the pre-condition and post-conditions.
in Eiffel they can also include an implementation. as opposed to instances in Java.
that don't have enough information for reuse.


Alias
-------------------------------------------------
We want to provide a common interface for different kinds of resources.
And the ability to alias operators will help us to make different things.
to look like if they were all collections (tables or dictionaries).

Weiher's Polymorphic Identifiers
================================================

Weiher's paper on Polymorphic identifiers and Storage combinators was the inspiration for all of this paper.
On the polymorphic identfiers paper Weiher show that we need an Uniform Access Principle applied to every kind of data,
the same way it is used in Eiffel for computation.

In order to achive that Uniformity for in-program, localhost and remote storage.
Weiher shows we need 3 core concepts.

* Polymorphic Identfiers (URIs in RESTful Architecture)
* Scheme Handlers (Clients in RESTful Architecture)
* References (Computational Resources in RESTful Architecture)


Polymorphic Identifiers (PIs)
---------------------------------------------------------
These are URIs that serve as polymorphic names for storage locations.
PIs are implemented as actual URIs, with the scheme part designating the handler.
This allows them to seamlessly integrate both internal and external resources using a common syntax.
They're not just similar to URIs - they literally are URIs with added compiler and runtime support.

For example:

```
person                         // Plain identifier (uses default scheme)
var:person/name                // Access 'name' property of 'person' object
file://tmp/button.png          // Access a file
http://www.example.com/button.png  // Access a web resource
file:{env:HOME}/rfcs/{rfcName}     // Dynamic URI with template variables
```

References
------------------------------------------------------------
Mediate access to specific storage locations.
References hide variations in access mechanics from clients.
indexed references (offsets to context),
messaging references (L-Value-specific messages),
and keyed references (generic access messages with a key).

When you use a PI,
the system creates a Reference object behind the scenes.
This Reference knows how to:

### Read/write the storage location
You use the same syntax to access any resource regardless of type:

```
name := var:person/name         // Reading a property
var:person/name := newName      // Writing a property
```

#### Perform optimized access
The Reference implementation in the paper can access data in three ways:
```
// From the Reference implementation:
if (offset >= 0) {
  return ((id*)target)[offset];    // Direct memory access (fastest)
} else if (getSelector) {
  return [target perform:getSelector];  // Message sending
} else {
  return [target objectForKey:attributeName];  // Dictionary access
}
```


Scheme-handlers
-------------------------------------------------------------
Each scheme-handler manages a specific store.
They translate from identifiers to references and define the operations for interacting with specific types of storage.
They work like protocol clients, responsible for the abstraction over storage types.

Scheme-handlers map the scheme part of the URI to actual implementation code:
```
// Define a scheme handler for 'rfc:' URIs
base := ref:http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc
scheme:rfc := RelativeScheme schemeWithBase: base
```

Then you can use it:

```
// Download an RFC to a local file
file:rfc1738 := http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1738
// With the scheme defined above, this is equivalent to:
file:rfc1738 := rfc:rfc1738
```

Real-World Benefits
-----------------------------------------------------
Concretely, this system solves problems like:

Switching Storage Backends: You can change an object to use dictionary storage instead of instance variables without changing any client code.
Parametrized Access: You can access properties dynamically:

name := valueAccessor value

External Resource Integration: You can work with files/web in the same way as objects:
```
// Set up a custom resource scheme
scheme:image := RelativeScheme schemeWithBase: http://www.example.com

// Now use it with simple names
button := image:button.png
```

In summary
---------------------------------------------------------------
The whole system essentially lets you work with any kind of storage - memory, files, web, custom stores - using a consistent syntax.


Designing a solution
=================================================
So we want a RESTful API the Design space has the following level.

In-program
: Resources that live in the same program. Like variables, objects, tables, dictionaries.
  Examples:

  -- Read a single person out of a list of contacts.
  `conan := contacts["O'Brien"]`

Localhost
: Resources (files, images) that live in the some computer as the program.
  Examples

  -- Read a text file out of a directory:
  `my_file := home["my_file.txt"]`


Remote Resources
: Are resources that live in the internet and can be accessed by a protocol such as HTTP, ftp, etc.
  Example
  `repos := github["/orgs/dotnet/repos"]`

In summary we want to access a an In-program Dictionary or Table,
with the same interface we use to access a remote application.

Implementation
=================================================

In order to create our solution we need to define:

* REST Verbs
* RESOURCE and a
* REST_RESOURCE

And do three implementations:

1. In-program: a HASH_TABLE as a REST_RESOURCE
2. Localhost: a DIRECTORY as a REST_RESOURCE.
3. Remote: for example GITHUB_API as REST_RESOURCE

REST Verbs
-------------------------------------------------
We will look, at how to implement REST Verbs as an interface.

In table [RestVerbs] we have defined the elements of the protocol.
We can code said protocol as a `deferred class REST`

```Eiffel
note
	description: "[
		{REST_W_STORAGE}.
		A contract representation of the http verbs.
		to be used to define {REST_RESOURCES}
	]"
	author: "Alejandro Garcia"
	date: "$Date$"
	revision: "$Revision$"

deferred class interface
	REST_W_STORAGE [R -> , S -> ]

	extend (data: R; key: detachable URL_PATH)
			-- equivalent to http POST
			-- Submits data; may change state or cause side effects
		ensure
			data_must_be_stored: attached item (last_inserted_key)

	force (data: R; key: URL_PATH)
			-- equivalent to http PUT
			-- Replaces the resource's representation with the request content.
		require
			requested_a_known_key: has_key (key)
		ensure then
			item_must_be_stored: attached item (key)

	has_key (key: URL_PATH): BOOLEAN
			-- equivalent to http HEAD
			-- Same as GET but without a response body

	item alias "[]" (key: URL_PATH): R assign force
			-- equivalent to http GET
			-- Requests a resource representation; retrieves data only.
		require else
			key_must_exist: has_key (key)
		ensure then
			error_500: Result /= Void

	last_inserted_key: URL_PATH
			-- there is NO equivalent for this in http protocol.
			-- but is necessary to keep the Command / Query Separation principle in Eiffel

	remove (key: URL_PATH)
			-- equivalent to http DELETE
			-- Removes the specified resource.
		ensure then
			item_was_truly_eliminated: not has_key (key)

	trace (key: URL_PATH): detachable S
			-- equivalent to http TRACE
			-- Performs a loop-back diagnostic test. In our interpretation since this is debugging operation.
			-- It would return the actual [S]tored data.
		require
			must_be_stored: has_key (key)
		ensure
			error_500_internal_server_error: Result /= Void

end -- class REST_W_STORAGE

```

a RESOURCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fielding emphasizes that:

    > "The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource.
    > Any information that can be named can be a resource."

```Eiffel
@include('./resource.e')
```

a REST_RESOURCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------

And finally a REST_RESOURCE is a RESOURCE that can answer to REST Requests.


It is important to note that a RESOURCE is uniquely identified by their name.
so two resources with the same name, MUST be the same.
And we can express that relation ship in code by redefining the `is_equal` feature.

```
include code of the REST RESOURCE
```

and we must test it.

```
include code of the test
```

RESOURCE_NAME Server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since RESOURCEs are unique by their name.
We need a register of all the resources and make sure that for each name,
only one resource exists.

This class has the same behavior as the Domain Name Server (DNS).
Has in the internet, is a table of URLs and the appropriate REST_RESOURCE
to answer to them.

In Eiffel this could potentially be done using once classes.
BUT they don't work properly for ONCE objects.

NOTE :: Check this implementation


Implementing an In-program REST_RESOURCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have a REST_RESOURCE and the RESOURCE_NAME_SERVER

We will start by creating a HASH_TABLE that behaves like a REST_RESOURCE

```
include the code for the TABLE_RESOURCE.e
```


Implementing an Localhost RESOURCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we will cross the barrier of the program and now use a RESOURCE in our system like
if it was inside our program.


```
Include the code listing of the DIRECTORY_RESOURCE
```

HERE is the test.


### Another Localhost Resource.

As we have stablishide in the Background a resource not only can be static,
like an image. It can also be dynamic like a PHP script or a database.
to prove this point we are going to code another resource.
this one for a SQLite database.
Observe how configure and accessing it till uses a the UAP
with a URL.
but now we are communicating with a database.

Implementing a REMOTE_RESOURCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A remote resource brings us the the biggest challenge.

It forces us to consider a CLIENT_PROXY that will expose,
all the functionality we want a remote resource to have.

Weiher calls this SCHEMA_HANDLERS since they know how to use the communication protocol
HTTP, ftp, file, etc. that the resource needs.

I Prefer the term CLIENT_PROXY since it is already defined in the REST literature.

```
Refactor the coder in API_RESOURCE.e to create a generic
CLIENT_PROXY over strings.
and then a JSON_API_RESOURCE that is an REST[JSON,STRING]
and the a GITHUB_API_RESOURCES that is REST[OBJECT, JSON] or something like that
```

Experiment Results
============================================================================
Back to our our motivating example.
Now let's build the challenge with our RESTful library.


so going to back to the [Challenge]

We can express our solution with in-program RESOURCES as:

```
Include link to the test that surprised me that it works
```

And this table compares the results
to the "ideal" the NuShell solution , the Original Eiffel Solution and Finally the RESTful solution.

Notice how close the Restful solution is to the ideal.


Lessons Learned
==============================

After all that work what did we gain?
-------------------------------------------
The capability to mix and match local and remote resources.
  as if they were part of the current system.

Why didn't you use the same terms as Weiher did?
-------------------------------------------------------
While making this library I discovered that many of the concepts,
  discussed by Weiher already had analogs in the RESTful Architecture.
  And made the conscious decisions to remain within that domain.
  As much as possible.
  To take advantage of vast literature in RESTful Architecture.


Weiher uses terms like:
schema handlers to mean the PROXY and protocols

Polymorphic identifiers to mean URI and URLs

Stores to mean Resources.

and ______ to refer to HTTP verbs.

In the Eiffel implementation I tried to maintain as much as possible relation with the RESTful API domain and analogies.

Because I didn't see the need to invent new words for the concepts we were dealing with.
And it made the access to a vast library of knowledge of the REST architecture that needed very little in terms of comprehension.


The impedance mist-mach between REST and Object Oriented is not as wide as expected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many concepts in REST don't map perfectly to OOP.
But OOP being a general programming language can handle the ambiguity.

Here is a list of mismatches found:

| in the REST Architect                                                                            | Eiffel's Object Oriented Programming                                               | Solution                                                                                                                                                                |
| Resource are uniquely identified by a name                                                         | Each object is unique, even if they point to the same data                         | The RESOURCE_NAME_SERVER that follows the registry design pattern [^KarineArnoutThesis]. Makes sure that on creation first we check if the resource didn't exist before |
| HTTP Verbs define a protocol                                                                      | the TABLE deferred class defines other features                                    | the REST class help define the HTTP verbs in terms of the TABLE features                                                                                                |
| No separation between Command and Queries, and POST and PUT operations will still return content   | In Eiffel the Command / Query Separation Principle is *fundamental*               | the `deferred class REST` there is the last_inserted_key to handle the operation result like POST that create a new data in the entity                                  |
| Is weakly typed and the Request Headings give 'hints' of the data types but they are not mandatory | Statically typed, forces us to know before hand what  kind we will be working with | Constraint Generosity `REST[R,S]` allows us to separate the types of the Representation and the Storage itself                                                          |

Other Eiffel such as: Void-safety and SCOOP (Simple Concurrent Object Oriented Programming).
Will be useful in a future work, implementing Weiher Storage Combinators [link_to_papers].

Other concepts map easily between RESTful Architecture and Eiffel's OOP.

| in RESTful Architecture                                                                                                           | In Eiffel                                                                                  | Why it works |
| HTTP status 400 Client Error                                                                                                      | Are pare-condition violations and are responsibility of the client                          |              |
| HTTP status 500 Internal Server Error                                                                                             | Are post-condition violation, meaning the server / supplier couldn't satisfy               |              |
| Every piece of data is a RESOURCE, there are value resources like an image or a file, and computational resources like PHP script | Everything is an object, and objects can be only value objects or have complete behaviors |              |

Design by contract is complicated
------------------------------------

Since a Pre-condition can only be weakened,
that means that we must put the most stringent pre-conditions on the top of our hierarchy.

but since a post-condition can only be strengthened
then we can put the most lenient post-condition at the top of the inheritance hierarchy.
and strength it below in the hierarchy.

now the problem is with the feature signature.
the input arguments can be considered a pre-condition.
they must be almost exactly the same as the signature of the ancestor.
so if an argument is marked as detachable (i.e. void then the argument must remain detachable)
but the output of a feature is like a post-condition which can be strengthened,
so a detachable result can be made attached???

Future Work
=============================================

This article will continue in two directions:

* Create more BASIC_RESOURCES
* Implement Storage Combinators

Continue Exploring the Design Space
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This article only covers one branch,
of the possible combinations
for BASIC_RESOURCES.

Since our goal was to show that "Unified Access" was possible
for different locations of the problem.
Now that we have shown that it is possible,
we can increase the practicality by creating more classes.

Implement Weiher's Storage Combinators
----------------------------------------------------------

One of Weiher's powerful insights is that once we have all the components
implementing the `REST` interface then creating combinations like pipelines,
becames easy.

In future work we will implement the Storage Combinators mechanism.
To create new pipelines.

Conclusions
==========================================================

Warhorse insight that we can use the mechanisms in large systems to organize the code of our own program.
is very powerful and can provide guidance to develop more usable experiences for developers.

the Restful Eiffel cluster has the potential to became a very useful library for Eiffel developers
And Eiffel advanced programming features made an ideal programming language to specify the components of restful application.


Footnotes
===============================================================================
[^conditional]: POST and PATCH are cacheable when responses explicitly include freshness information and a matching Content-Location header.
