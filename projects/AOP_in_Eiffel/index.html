**Architecture-Oriented Programming in Eiffel**

A Conjecture
===============================================================================

Architecture Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that increases reusability and modularity of Object Oriented Languages.
By identifying patterns found at the *architecture level* of *systems* and shrinking them at the *code level* of *programs*.
The advanced features of Eiffel, such as Genericity, Aliasing, and Design by Contract, make it an ideal environment to implement AOP.
And it would result in smaller code with more reusability in Eiffel programs.

Background
================================================================================

Architecture Oriented Programming (AOP) is the name given by Weiher and Hirschfeld to their ideas in developing the Objective Smalltalk language.
The main idea is delightfully simple:

>  What if we took inspiration from the architecture of big systems,
>    and shrink the techniques to organize a single program.

(Weiher, 2020 a)  identified the first patterns and also made a summary in the YouTube presentation: "Can programmers escape the gentle tyranny of call return" (Weiher, 2020 b)
Also, each pattern was published independently. As is shown in table [Summary]:

Uncertainties (Known-Unknowns)
================================================================================

In his conference, Marcel P. Weiher says that the comments for Unicon made it decide to create a new language (Objective Smalltalk) instead of a library for an existing language.
And on this project, I'm doing exactly that: creating a library, not a new language.
So it might be a bad idea.
However, the advanced tools of Eiffel make this a better approach in this language.

My plan
================================================================================

To get the implementation of AOP in the Eiffel, I intend to:

First
-----------

Write a complete design by contract specification of the architecture patterns identified.
This will require also the description of frame rules.
Probably using "model queries" (Polikarpova et al. 2012)

Second
-----------

I'll make several implementations.
Here, I'll experiment.
Where I'd ask a set of 5 developers to each
develop their storage combinator and polymorphic identifier.
Then, I will try to compose all of them.
And survey the developers to see how they feel about the patterns' specification and composability.

Third
-----------

To test that the code based on AOP is more reusable than the current call return style. I will reimplement a project in Eiffel (like the Nino Webserver).
On AOP and measure using Avontis & Mingis 93 "Metrics from Object-Oriented Design."


Future work (avenues to explore)
=============================================================================

It seems pretentious to talk about "future work" when discussing a proposal for a future project.
But, assuming that I can achieve the goals in the plan. I.e., a specification and implementation for AOP in Eiffel.
What other avenues will open for exploration?
At the moment, I can imagine the following:

Shrink other architectural patterns at the level of programs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weiher has currently only identified six architectural patterns and shrunk them to the level of programs.
So, a natural progression of this work would be to specify and code even more patterns.

For example, how would a queue-based architecture (like Rabbit MQ) look at the program level? Something like Erlang with OTP?

How would an Event Sourcing architecture look at the program level?
Could we reuse the agent and pub/sub mechanism in GUI Eiffel for other object communication, not only GUI?
Reusing it as the main means of communication among objects.


Given a specification, can ChatGPT program an implementation?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we follow the headlines, there are two ways of thinking about programming and Large Language Models (LLMs like chatgpt).
Either:

> Programming is dead, and ChatGPT killed it.

or

> ChatGPT and their inherent hallucinations make it irrelevant to programming.

However, I think Design by Contract (DBC) opens an avenue for collaboration between the two approaches.
In this collaboration, humans would write a specification in DBC  with the appropriate frame rules.
Then ChatGPT would try to code to the specification.

So it would be fascinating to see if, given a spec for AOP, we could get ChatGPT to implement it.

Others
-----------------------------
While developing this work, other avenues of growth will become more apparent.


Expected Contributions
================================================================================

As a result of this work, I expect to deliver the following work products.

- Write a design by contract specification of the AOP patterns documented by Weiher.
- Program an Eiffel implementation of said patterns.
- Share the specification and its benefits with the academic and development communities so they can use AOP.
