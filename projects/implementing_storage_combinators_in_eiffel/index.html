                  **In-program REST for Eiffel**
Applyng the UAP (Universal Access Principle) to local and remote resources.

	By asking: What would happen if every collection in a program had a URL as identifier and a Resful API as interface?,
Weiher's Resources[^1] unlock a new familiar way of software composition.
WHere the now familiar ways of composing cloud API's can be applied to the level of single programs.
Whit components that by implementing a REST API can compose into new servers.

Introduction
===============================================================================

We could argue that the most successful software composition example are Unix pipes.
Where independent programs, by limiting them selves to a very simple API can be chained togetther in compositions.
That where inamigable to the authors of each each individual program.

Another successful example of software composition, are the orchestration of services through RestAPI's.
Services like "If This Then That" (iftt.com)
Have connected programs livinig in different servers, develop in different languages.

Learning from those successes Marcel P. Weiher proposes to organize our single program the same way.
Using this techniques Weiher has manage to compose complex functionality with
Caching, local and remote resources, and synchonous resources.

In this paper, I present the Iterative process that leadme to implement Weihers Ideas in Eiffel.

Motivating Example
================================================================================

Suppose inside a program we read a Bitmap image.
We wanto to store it in a variable,
flip one of the bits.
And then save the varible, as a text file again.

This is seems like a simple image and yet, let's look at the implementation.

Reading o local file
----------------------------------------------------------------
```Eiffel
class
    APPLICATION

create
    make

feature {NONE} -- Initialization

    make
            -- Run application.
        do
            create input_file.make_open_read ("input.txt")
            create output_file.make_open_write ("output.txt")

            from
                input_file.read_character
            until
                input_file.exhausted
            loop
                output_file.put (input_file.last_character)
                input_file.read_character
            end

            input_file.close
            output_file.close
        end

feature -- Access

    input_file: PLAIN_TEXT_FILE
    output_file: PLAIN_TEXT_FILE

end
```

end
```

Finally uploading a file through http
-------------------------------------------

Finally let's set it through an API.

```chatgpt
Can you create the code here for an  Eiffel API that connects and posts an image to the flickr API
```

Let's create a composition
----------------------------------------------
To finalize the example le's think
How could we develop a Cache,
That gets remote files,
and stores them locally for the next calling.


```chatgpt
Can you create the code, that reads an image from a remote server?
and then stores it locally.
```

Now let's compare the alternative with software made for composition.

```chatgpt

Can you create a Bash script that search or a file locally,
if it doesn't find it, downloads the file from an image server.
Stores it locally,
and the next time, we ask for the same image it reads the one on the local file.

```

Let's observe the same script in NuShell a new generation shell that is also
a replacement for bash, that is extremely productive.

```chatgpt
Can you create an NuSHell script that searches for an image, in a local directory.
If it doesn't find it then downoald it from a remote server.
store it locally, so that the next time,
we ask for it it reads the one locally?
```

As you can see the NuShell script is very expressive,
it represents that we want to do and nothing else.
Whereas the algorithmic version in both Eiffel and Python
Is riddle with accidental complexity, and minutia that hides what we really want to achieve.

On this paper we will see how Weiher's Storage Combinators can be implemented to make the version in Eiffel almost as expressive as the one in Nushell.

Composition in the real world.
======================================================================

In the era of WebServices and API's we have seen the delopment of Systems composed of several different API's
from different vendors and independent developers.
This composiitions have been called Mashups

```chatpt
Insert citation for the book on mashups
and our previous thesis on the subject.
```


What made Mashups possible is that every API has a comamn interface in the form of a REST API.

A REST Api was formalized in Fiedings thesis in the following 6 principles.

````chatgpt
What are the 6 principles formalized by fielding in his thesis about Rest.
````

Those principles we can see them expressed as the "Verbs" in the HTTP protocol definition.

```chatgpt
Insert a table of the 7 http verbs what do they mean, if they are Safe, Idem-pontent and cachable.
```

Now locally a Storage can be thought as a String_Table (a Dictionary in Python).
Indexed by the "path" of the resource.

So we can create a relationship between,
http Verbs.
On this paper I intend to follow, the HTTP analogy
as far as we can take it.

To keep thinking about the fact that we are composing http resources.





Development
======================================================================

1st Iteration a Restful API
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first characteristic of an `Storage Combinator` is that it respects a Rest API
given a "route" or PATH.

so the precise definition of a REST_STORE is an instance ("effective class")
that implements the REST_STORE abstract_class ("deferred class")

```note_to_self
insert the contract view, at a certain commit
using bash code that emacs can interpret.
```

Notice that we have the Pre-condition (require)
that the user  of the class is asking for data that we have (has)
if we don't have it then it returns and error_404 to the user
this is applying Design-By-Contract to the webserver.
Also observe that if it is our method the one that doesn´t fullfill a request would be the equivalent of 500 error.

Also notice that PUT requires the path to exists.
Whereas POST doesn't have the precondition, it doesn't even require the path to be given so it is detachable.

### Applying the RESTy API to a STRING_TABLE

Now the implementation of the REST API is very succint.
Thanks to the fact that Eiffel Library Collection has since the Beginning

```note_to_self
insert citation to the communications of the ACM article on the design of the libraries
And citation to the book.. where BM talks about the design of the eiffel libraries.
```

This care to the conformance of the librires will be very useful for us since it willl save a lot of work on the implementation.

### The implementation

Now that we know the specificiation (eiffel: Contract) then we can proceed with the implementation
That in this case is as as simple as:

```note_to_self
Insert the code view at a certain point in time.
and write notes in it's

### Examples

Given this implementation a dictionary (eif STRING_TABLE) can be used like in thi examples (tests)

```chatgpt
Crete Eiffel test examples of storing long paths,
and also examples where asking or a non stored path
returns an error 404
and see how could I trigger a 500 error.
```

2nd Iteration a RESTy API's for an 'unreliable store'
================================================================================

Our first example a Dictionary was the platonic ideal of stores.
It is single threaded and as long as our program is running we can assume,
that what ever we put in the dictionary, we can get back.

But the real world is more messy. Things go missing, [^j1]
They reappear (like socks in the fridge)

So for this we will create a RESTLY_DIRECTORY
I.e. a filesystem directory that implements REST-like api for the retrival and writing of text_files.

The important characteristic is that a File can be removed by another operating system process.
While no one is looking at the washer  cycle.

### The new contract

```note_to_self
in jj checkout the version of the contract that can handle detachable return values.
and show that the more strict contract can inherit from the detachable type
but not the other way around.
```

Also show the current class diagram.
Where the REST_TABLE inherits from the more strict store, and the
file store inherits from the detachable one.

### The implementation?
    propbably I shouldn't put the implementation here, just a link (including revision) with the correct version of the implentation

### Example tests
    THis is the important part.
    Show that assigining something new to the REST_API will create a new text file with that name and contents.
    then show that we can trigger a post conditin in  Eiffel

[j1]: I think all of humany has had this problem.
[j2]: This has happened to me... I cannot be the only one :-)

3rd Iteration Mapper RESTapi for object transformers
====================================================================================
A REST_MAPPER
is-a REST_STORE with the property that the path and value.
can be modified before being stored.

Which now give us the problem, that now what we storet is not what we get.
So that requires creating a new Contract.

```note_to_self
insert the code for the new REST_DETABLE_TWO_TYPES class.
and show line by line the changes that were necessary
SHOW THAT We can redfine the simple clothing store.

Insert the diagram of inheritance,
between abstract classes.
```

### Show the implementation

### Show the tests, and delete a file before calling get , bit i

Show that eventhough we stored a name with lowar_case, we can have a class.
That by the item you do a get, that has passed the precondition
We can trigger the post-condition.

4th Iteration a REST_RESOURCE
==================================================================
What distinguis a REST_RESOURCE from just a REST_STORE
is that a resourc *has* an identifier.
That is a URL that uniquely identifies the resource.
It is so uninque in fact that changing the resource is not allowed,
and trying to do so would create a new REST_RESOURCE with the new ID
rather than modify the current one.

This is the definition of an IDENTIFIER
-------------------------------------------------

```note_to_self
Insert the code of the IDENTIFIER
```

(1) Notice that it is-a 'URI'
(2) And that is an immutable value class (eif. 'expanded class')
Which means that we cannot change the values of any of the values once it is created.
(3) we are redefining the value setters to create new versions of the current resource, with the ne we value.
(4) Observe that we use the word ONCE which is a singleton, once this resource is created, it won't create a new object. But will be an insntance of the current one.

Now that we know what an IDENTIFIER *is*

We can define a REST_RESORCE asking

> REST_RESOURCE is-a REST_STORE that is uniquely identified by a UNIQUE_URI
> and where all it's content has a 'subdirectory' where we will look for the entities.

```note_to_self
instert the REST_RESOURCE class with it's make_from_url method
```

(1) observe that we the prefix part is the subdiriectory, befare the entry.

Now let's create a RESOURCE_TABLE and  RESOURCE_DIRECtORY
they both inherit from UNIQUE_URI and from REST_STORE

Observe that now we have redefine the stores,
to consider the prefix that comes from the subdomain.
this only redirects the path.

### Examples
Show that creating two resources with the same url
is actually the same RESOURCE.

modifiying one of the urls creates a new RESOURCE

now show how creating a new directory, you don't need to specify the whole path anymore,
Since it is using the prefix.

### Exercises
create the Current_resource which is the resource that represents the direcotry where the current app is running.
create the env resource that represents environment variables currently defined in the operating system.

5th Iteration a REMOTE_RESOURCE
======================================================================

A REMOTE_RESOURCE is-a resource that knows how to connect, store and retrieve resources,
living outside the current program.
has-a inmutable unique identifier
has-a protocol proxy that knows how to connect and retrive resources.
is-a RESTFUL_STORE, where the values are actually stored in a remote server.

For example
------------------------------------
Let's look at some implementations in particular the HTPP ones


Tests
----------------------------------------------------
How well does this work in practice?


6th Iteration RESOURCE_COMBINATOR
============================================================================

A RESOURCE_COMBINATOR is a function that takes two REST_RESOURCeS and combines their operations,
to compose a new one. That is used independently of the original ones.

For example, the cache combinator.
-------------------------------------
So we want to cache the expensive http requests that we make to an external server.

Has as local_store the file writing one.
and as remote_store the one that is an http client.

7th Iteration RESOURCE_SERVER
===========================================================================

Up to this point, we have consumed resources.
But how can we "expose" our local resources.
To the exterior?

This communication must happen according to a protocol.
So that means we need now PROTOCOL Server,
that can publish our RESOURCES according to the rules of the protocol.

Going back to our motivating example
============================================================================

After all that work defining, and implementing REST_RESOURCES in Eiffel.
How does our original problem look like?



Conclussions
============================================================================

* Eiffels mature library, and advanced features made it an ideal candidate to write this specification.

* REST RESOURCES works because RESOURCES are a "deep class"
  Osternout, claims that in order for a class to be useful, it must be deep.
  Meaning it must have a small public interface, that hides a complex internal structure.
  In our case using the well defined and small RESTFUL constratints has afforded us the freedom,
  to  create complex compositions of small parts.

** The fact that http is a stateless protocol, gives the benefits of Functional Programming


Lessons Learned
===================================================

There is no Specification without prototype.

This work started as an attempt to specify Weiher's work on Architecture Oriented Programming.
Mostly, because I was confused by some of the terms used, in his paper
For example the word "reference" is used diferently in the 2016 paper,
than in the the 2019 paper of Storage Combinators.

Also I didn't like the name "Polymorphic Identifiers", to me it sounded like a contradiciton
an Identifier shouldn't change shape so no polymorphic.
But by formalizing it turns out that the Identifier or the name URI uniform resource *identfier*.
and the Resource is what the "polymorphic identifier meant.

I think that Storage Combinators are a "rediscovery" of the RESTful architectural style with two key innovations.

1. It applies the RESOURCE concept to level of the program. So basically. What if every variale, dictionary, etc. in our
   program was addresable by a URI ?

2. It makes standard combinators allowing us to create new Resources, as the combination of others in Dynamic.
   i.e. not compiled way.

3. What the CSP specification brings to the table is a formally verified specification of REST.
  That helped up uncover blind spots in the Storage Combinators work.
