An independent research lab exploring the future of tools for thought.
================================================================

We envision a new computer that amplifies human intelligence. A system
that helps you think more clearly, collaborate more effectively, and is
available anywhere and anytime. Though the specifics of our work
continue to evolve, everything we do is in pursuit of this vision.

Research Tracks
---------------------------------------------------------------

Our research spans a wide variety of domains from theoretical computer
science to practical user experiences. We currently have three primary
research themes.

### Malleable Software

Designing software environments where people can customize tools in the
moment to meet their unique needs.

### Programmable Ink

Discovering a dynamic medium for sketching ideas where adding behaviors
and interaction is as natural as applying ink to paper.

### [Local-First](/local-first)

Exploring software architecture that returns data to users and enables
collaboration in every tool.


Our Writing
==============================================================

This are the innovations that have been ocupaying our minds lately
