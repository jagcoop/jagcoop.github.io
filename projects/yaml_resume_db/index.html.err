Json Resume is a great way to keep your resume updated.
However there two things missing:

1. Json its an ugly format to look by hand.
2. It would be nice to build a database of the knowledge and skills of team,
   based on their json resume.



2025-01-12: Starting the project
=================================================================

In order to start this project I need:

1. A couple of json resumes
1. the json schema of json resumes.
1. Translate the json schema to a terminus db instance.
1. insert the json resume in terminusdb
1. query the terminusdb  to get the tag cloud of projects we know on.

Now I hope to make this document a literate program.
So let's see how far I get it to be.

Get a couple of json resumes
