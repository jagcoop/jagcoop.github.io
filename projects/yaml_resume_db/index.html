                        **Yaml Resume Database**
                           Version 1.1


Json Resume is a great way to keep your resume updated.
However there two things missing:

1. Json its an ugly format to look by hand.
2. It would be nice to build a database of the knowledge and skills of team,
   based on their json resume.



2025-01-12: Starting the project
=================================================================

In order to start this project I need:

1. A couple of json resumes
1. the json schema of json resumes.
1. Translate the json schema to a terminus db instance.
1. insert the json resume in terminusdb
1. query the terminusdb  to get the tag cloud of projects we know on.

Now I hope to make this document a literate program.
So let's see how far I get it to be.

Get a couple of json resumes
---------------------------------------------------------------

```nushell
    $ mkdir test
    $ http get https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thomasdavis/c9dcfa1b37dec07fb2ee7f36d7278105/raw/c0399b7abb13fe63912843ca6f6c90af63fb28ae/resume.json |
    > save --force test/1.json
    $ http get https://gist.githubusercontent.com/elviejo79/ab0802ef51ac9f53defe686e7fae452b/raw/1d0be3cb5c3fb03259a1141779b632397524cb55/resume.json |
    > save --force test/2.json
```


Let's get the schema to validate the files

```nushell
    $ http get https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/v1.0.0/schema.json | 
    > save test/old.schema.json
```

The schema that is in json schema store is for draf-04 of schema specification. 
And we need to update. it

```nushell
    > ajv migrate -s test/old.schema.json -o test/resume.schema.json
```


We also must make sure that they are
[valid json resumes according to the schema](https://chatgpt.com/share/67849193-d2c0-8007-82ce-26ae4d84f5d9).

```nushell
    $ ajv validate -s test/resume.schema.json -d test/1.json --strict=false -c ajv-formats
    $ ajv validate -s test/resume.schema.json -d test/2.json --strict=false -c ajv-formats
```

2025-01-17 Transform the json_resume.scha to terminsdb schema
================================================================
It took me 5 days of 14 hours to create this migration script from jsonata.
But now I can automaticall translate from json_resume.schema to terminusdb.schema.

!!! note
    I hope someday this transformation script can transform all the json schemas to jsonata.

so now let's execute the jsonata query that transforms this one schema

```nushell
   $ cat test/resume.schema.json | jfq --query-file test/resume_schema_to_terminusdb.jsonata | save --force test/terminus.resume.schema.json
```

So simple and yet that query has been one of the most difficult things I've written.

What should I do next?
---------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Mutate one of the example resumes so that is almos the same as another 
    To demonstrate that eventhough we are storing several resumes.
    The quantity of entinties in the database doesn't grow because the entities are the same
    Just linked from different documents
[ ] Maybe run the schema commands by hand. So that I get to learn what I need to write.
[ ] Personalize the resume_schema_to_terminusdb.json I think the main table JSON_RESUME
    shouldn't have the @unfolded:[] key BUT  maybe it does... I need to check it.
[ ] Run terminusdb store init to create a new storage
[ ] Think I'll need to set up the routes of the schema and the instances... although I don't know how
[ ] Once the schema is created by hand:
    Try to insert 3 resumes!
[ ] Run queries to show that eventhough you inserted 3 resumes you don't have 3 different entities
    They should repeat!
[ ] Once I know the process by hand:
    try to pipe resume_schema_to_terminusdb.json file | terminusdb db doc -g
