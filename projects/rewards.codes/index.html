                        **Rewards Codes**
                        A Simple Loyalty Platform for *Small* Businesses Using **Big** Strategies


[Rewards Codes - RwC](https://rewards.codes)
Rewards Codes is a straightforward loyalty platform designed to help small businesses implement big strategies for customer retention. This project evolved from a previous initiative, "SigueMS," which was an SMS interface for Twitter.

Why do 50% of loyalty strategies fail? Mainly because they are:

1. Hard to use,
2. Hard to understand, and
3. Offer unappealing rewards.

Rewards Codes addresses these challenges by adopting best practices from the retail and service industries. We focus on:

* Simplicity: With just two easy steps, our platform is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
* Accessibility: We use globally recognized communication platforms, making it easy for businesses and customers to engage.
* Valuable Rewards: By allowing businesses to exchange reward points within our network, customers always have access to appealing, desirable rewards.

Thanks to the support of our clients, Rewards Codes has become a tool for fostering positive communication between businesses and their customers. It’s fascinating how an initial customer visit can grow into an ongoing dialogue that includes service feedback, repeat purchases, product launches, and even quick answers to frequently asked questions. Ultimately, this leads to stronger, more meaningful relationships.

### What’s Next for Rewards Codes?

We’re continually evolving to meet the needs of small businesses. Our next steps include expanding the network of businesses that can exchange rewards, introducing new customer engagement features like creating and updating appointments and orders automatically, and exploring partnerships with additional communication platforms. Our goal is to make it even easier for businesses to connect with their customers, strengthen loyalty, and drive growth.

2024-10-15: Simple architecture 
=================================================================

# Architecture Overview:

Our system architecture revolves around two primary microservices, each serving a crucial function:

Rewards Microservice: This microservice handles the core functionality of giving and redeeming rewards, retrieving balance and account information, and managing overall rewards activity for businesses.

Messaging & Notifications Microservice: This service manages all the interactions between businesses and their customers, including messages and notifications, ensuring smooth and timely communication.

At the center of these microservices is an API Gateway, which provides controlled access to them. This gateway allows external applications to interact with the services securely and efficiently.

For data storage, we employ a Graph Database to record and analyze all customer-business interactions. The use of a graph structure helps us map relationships between customers, businesses, and rewards in a flexible and scalable way.

## Recent Addition: Chatbot Module

We've recently expanded the architecture by integrating a Chatbot Module. Initially, the main microservice interacted with an external service to handle business context exclusively. However, recognizing the need for more meaningful conversations, we are developing additional endpoints to incorporate user context alongside business information.

This enhancement allows the chatbot to provide more personalized, relevant responses, making the platform even more engaging for customers.

## User Context Module

To enrich the chatbot's ability to interact with users meaningfully, we are implementing a User Context Module, which works through two complementary bots:

Classifier Bot: This bot's role is to determine whether a prompt requires querying the database for specific user data or if it can be answered using only business context. This first step ensures that the system responds efficiently by directing the query to the correct source.

Context Bot: Once the Classifier Bot identifies the need for user data, the Context Bot generates the necessary queries to fetch that data. It then supplies this additional user context to the chatbot, allowing it to return an enriched response with deeper insights.

By utilizing these two bots together, the system can deliver more personalized interactions, improving the user experience and fostering stronger connections between businesses and their customers.

### Real-Life Example:

Here’s how the system works in a real-world scenario:

A user asks the chatbot for a recommendation for a place to have dinner. Initially, the chatbot (powered by the Classifier Bot) determines that it needs more than just general business information to give a personalized suggestion. The Classifier Bot recognizes that the best way to provide an accurate recommendation is by considering the user's past preferences.

The system creates a query that checks if the user has previously visited and liked any restaurants within the network of businesses. After executing the query, the chatbot retrieves a list of restaurants the user enjoyed in the past.

Additionally, using data stored in the Graph Database, the Context Bot also identifies similar businesses that other users have liked, which match the user's previous preferences. With this information, the chatbot responds with a personalized dinner recommendation, tailored not only to the user's history but also suggesting similar options based on other users' preferences.

This process ensures the response feels highly personalized, increasing the chances of the user being satisfied with the recommendation, and strengthening their loyalty to the businesses in the network.
