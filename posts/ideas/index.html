# **How to write your ideas?** #

It is very common as a student, no matter what we are studying, to find it important to know how to writeâ€”not only letters but also our ideas. I have been struggling with the fact that I have to learn and write, and maybe it sounds easy in theory, but in practice, it is not as easy as it looks. But why?

**The recipe way.**

I have realized that there are many ways to express an idea that comes to mind, but we definitely always need to keep in mind that we must have order. When we think, we always think in processes. When preparing food, we think about the entire process of its preparation, from the raw ingredients to the final dish. Similarly, ideas and the way we think when writing are exactly like a recipe. We have to start from the beginning.
There are some steps to follow in order to start writing like a pro:

-**Define Your Purpose**: Before you start writing, be clear about the objective of your idea. What do you want to achieve with it? Who is it aimed at? 
We need to have at least a clear idea of who we want to reach or who we want to target with our objectives. And, above all, what we want to achieve with our idea.

-**Brainstorm Ideas**: Write down all the ideas that come to mind related to the topic. Don't worry about order or coherence at this stage; just let your thoughts flow.
If your idea is about dogs, just write all about them, for example; pets, toys, dog food, bones, etc. There's more than meets the eye if we start thinking.

-**Organize Your Ideas**: Once you have a list of ideas, organize them into an outline or a mind map. This will help you see the overall structure of your idea and how the different points relate to each other.
Write them down in a notebook if you want, in English or Spanish. The important thing is that you see it's easier to organize them when you have them written down somewhere. It will also be easier to relate them to each other and start consolidating your main idea.

-**Write a Draft**: Start writing a draft based on your outline. Don't worry about perfection at this stage; the important thing is to get your ideas down on paper.
This is the point where the real practice begins. Just write about your ideas and start to see how they take shape. It will probably look rough at first, but as you keep writing, the way you do it will get better and better.

-**Review and Edit**: After writing the draft, take some time to review and edit it. Correct grammatical errors, improve coherence, and ensure your message is clear.
Read it over and over again. First and foremost, you must like what you read. If you don't, we will have to correct spelling, change words, and the syntax of our writing, perhaps several times, until it seems right to us.

-**Seek Feedback**: Share your writing with someone you trust and ask for their opinion. Feedback can help you improve and polish your idea.
You should always seek a second opinion. There's no better critic than someone who doesn't conceive the idea. Look for all kinds of critiques; sometimes life is tough, and other times it's not so much. Always keep that in mind.

-**Refine Your Work**: Based on the feedback received, make the necessary adjustments to improve your writing. Now, with all the steps of our recipe, we are ready to express our ideas and get the most out of them as they should be. Now, let's enjoy writing.
