**Track our day**

Dec 28Th, 2024

As I mentioned [before](/posts/Single_text_file),
I love using a text file to jot down what I'm working on
or capture unexpected thoughts that come to mind.

I acknowledge these distractions by writing them down.
With just a quick `Super + N` (or `windows + N`).
I can immediately type the idea, let it go,
and refocus in the task at hand.

Even with that love.
Sometimes I still forget to type my ideas.
and since I'm a believer in:

> Have Systems, not Goals.

On this post I explain my new system.

# Not a nagging reminder

What I want is a reminder to write in my single text file.
But one that doesn’t nag me too often,
only when necessary.

this is what I wrote:

``` bash
    $ cat ~/active_dirs/track_your_progress.nu
    #!/usr/bin/env nu

    let wrote_recently = /home/agarciafdz/.local/bin/jrnl --format json -from ("30 minutes ago" | into datetime | format date "%F %T") err> /dev/null | is-not-empty
    print $wrote_recently

    if not $wrote_recently {
       # Prompt the user for their daily affirmation using Zenity

       let last_title = /home/agarciafdz/.local/bin/jrnl -n 1 --format json   | from json | get entries.0.title
       let affirmation = (zenity --entry --title="Keep your focus" --text=$"Your last entry:\n ($last_title)")
       $affirmation | /home/agarciafdz/.local/bin/jrnl

    }
```

First, the script checks if I `$wrote_recently`,
defining 'recently' as the last 30 minutes."

If I haven't then it displays a little window (zenity).
Asking me to type what I'm doing.
While reminding me of the last entry in Single Text File.

This idea of reminding me of my last entry.
Helps me to find out if I have diverted from my actual goal.
Or If I'm distracted by a new shiny object.

# Schedule it every 5 minutes

On Linux, users schedule recurring tasks using a program called `cron`.
With `crontab -l` we can see a list of my current scheduled tasks.
With `tail -n 1` we can see the last line.
Which is the one I care about.

```bash
    $ crontab -l | tail -n 1
    */5 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus /home/agarciafdz/.cargo/bin/nu /home/agarciafdz/active_dirs/track_your_progress.nu
```

The part `*/5` means if the current minute is divisible by 5 (12:05, 12,10... etc.),
The `track_your_progress.nu` script will execute.

The advantage of this system.
Is that If wrote a note at 12:03,
then the cron task will check on me at 12:05.
Since I have written in the past half an hour.
That means I *won't* get an interruption.
But if at 12:35 I haven't written any other entry.
Then I get the popup asking me to update my activity log.

So if I keep continuously writing notes, no window might appear in a whole day.

# So how does it look?

In this screenshot,
you can see the dialog window in the top-right corner,
asking me to type what I’m doing.

![poup asking about my current task on top right corner](./poup_asking_about_my_current_task_on_top_right_corner.jpg)

At this time,
I was writing this article,
which made the reminder feel timely.

# I don't think this breaks flow.

The state of flow
(losing track of time when immersed in an enjoyable and demanding activity)
is very important to me.

I don't think this popup, breaks flow.
Because it is asking a question, related to the /current task/.
So it is actually a way to /remain in flow/.
Maybe, I'm not entirely sure,
because the window opening in the middle of my work *is* distracting.
But at the same time, it can be an opportunity to reflect on the current task.


Besides, If I really don't want to see the window,
just need to append to activity log more frequently.
Which is my goal anyway.


# Some lessons learned

## Chatgpt can help, but still it is a long way to go.

Although ChatGPT was a big help in creating the cronjob and script,
I still spent about 4 hours on this relatively simple task.
I think without ChatGPT it would have taken me like 2 days.

## Jrnl can generate json output

I didn't remember, but `jrnl` can generate json output.
of my saved activities and tags.
Which is great for further processing my notes.

For example this is my last note viewed as a json object

```json
    $ jrnl -n 1 --format json
    {
      "tags": {},
      "entries": [
        {
          "title": "reviewing the article with the suggestion by chatgpt.",
          "body": "",
          "date": "2024-12-28",
          "time": "21:30",
          "tags": [],
          "starred": false
        }
      ]
    }
```

## and NuShell is great at processing json output.

As you can see the `track_your_progress.nu` is a NuShell script.
I find the script surprisingly concise and readable.

I think this readability comes from:

- It uses pipes for everything, so script are read from left to right.
- it can process json in native way.

## I love tools that are well thought out.

There are very few tools that I love
But in this little project I got to play with 3 of them:

  - jrnl.sh
  - NuShell
  - Emacs (always ;-) )


# Conclusion

Writing remains the most important habit for a knowledge worker,
yet I still don’t practice it as often as I’d like.
But, by setting up *systems*, I can better support the *habits* I want to *cultivate*.
