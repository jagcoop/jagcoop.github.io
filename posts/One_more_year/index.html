# One More Year
December 18th, 2024
by *Agus Rumayor*

It's hard to say when it will end. My family has upheld a 50-year-old (possibly longer—we don't have exact records) tradition of organizing and celebrating the traditional posadas here in Mexico.

## How Did It Begin?
When my grandparents moved to Zacatecas, they settled in a neighborhood filled with young families. Every afternoon, after school, one kid—the one who owned the soccer ball—would yell out to gather the neighborhood children for a game. This impromptu event became a signal for all the moms to visit each other, exchange favors, chat about their kids (or share gossip), and knit together for new family members.

During this time, a few families decided to start celebrating the nine nights of posadas—a tradition that commemorates Mary and Joseph’s journey seeking shelter in Bethlehem. In those early years, only two or three families participated. Their children, about 4–7 per family, would sing, pray, and receive small treats like peanuts and winter fruits at the end of the night.

## The Tradition Shines
By the late 80s and 90s, the tradition had grown beyond just our family and neighbors. Two things made this possible:

Many of the original children grew up, started their own families, and brought them back to the posadas.
Nearby working-class neighborhoods began joining the celebration.
At its peak, the posadas drew crowds of about 300 people. So many families wanted to host that we had to pair two families for each night. These nights became full of singing, praying, piñatas, fireworks, candy, and gift-giving.

## A Modern Posada
The way we celebrate has evolved over the years, but the core elements remain. Here’s how we celebrate today:

### The Prayers
The prayers during the posada are split into four parts:

1. The Rosary
We start with the rosary, offering intentions such as gratitude or seeking support during difficult times. After each mystery, we sing Christmas carols.

2. La Novena
This is a special daily prayer that reflects on Mary and Joseph’s journey as they carried and cared for baby Jesus.

3. La Letanía
Traditionally prayed after the rosary, we now recite it after the novena while walking through the streets. To this day, we pray it in Latin.

4. Pedir Posada
This is the highlight of the night: a beautiful call-and-response song reenacting Mary and Joseph’s request for shelter.

### The Celebration
After the prayers, the hosting family serves dinner to all attendees and hands out small gifts to the children. While we still include a piñata with seven points (symbolizing the seven deadly sins), managing it with over 100 people is a logistical challenge these days!

## Looking Forward
As each year passes, we wonder how long we can continue this cherished tradition. Our family is now in its third generation of hosting posadas, but the challenges of maintaining it are becoming more evident. Many of my cousins have moved away, and the meaning of this tradition has shifted for each of us. For some, it’s rooted in the joyful memories of childhood, while for others, it’s about the spiritual connection and the act of prayer that remains at its core.

It’s not easy to sustain a tradition when its essence—prayer, sharing, and community—is at risk of being overshadowed by nostalgia or convenience. Yet, for now, we take pride in carrying it forward, gathering our community, and celebrating this beautiful piece of our heritage.

I hope I can write another One More Year post again, continuing to honor the legacy my grandparents started and keeping alive the spirit of posadas for as long as we can.
