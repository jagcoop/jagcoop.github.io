     **How a Trip to Argentina Renewed My Faith in Cooperatives**

December 9th, 2024
By Alejandro Garcia

Last week, I had the privilege of speaking with the leaders of two remarkable democratically run companies.
These conversations gave me a renewed sense of hope in cooperative models as
viable, ethical, and innovative structures for businesses.

The first was Hernán Wilkinson of **10Pines**, a company I’ve long admired for its groundbreaking work in Smalltalk
and its unique approach to organizational democracy.
The second was Duncan Coutts of **Well-Typed**,
a Haskell consulting firm I’ve had the pleasure of working with through my role at IOHK.
Both organizations exemplify a commitment to values-driven leadership, and both,
in their own way, stand as proof that a company can succeed while treating people with dignity and fairness.

This article focuses on my conversation with Hernán Wilkinson and the lessons I learned from **10Pines**.

# The Four Values That Define 10Pines

Hernán explained that **10Pines** was founded on four guiding principles:

1. **We want to be happy.**
2. **We want to pursue technical excellence.**
3. **We don't need to be millionaires to be happy.**
4. **We don't need to exploit people to become millionaires.**

These values are not just words on a wall.
They are embedded in every aspect of how the company operates,
from how they charge clients to how they handle decision-making.
It’s a philosophy that sets **10Pines** apart in the often cutthroat world of software development.

# Surprising Lessons from 10Pines

## No Sales Team
   In an industry dominated by aggressive sales tactics,
   **10Pines** has no salespeople.
   Hernán explained this choice: salespeople, motivated primarily by commissions,
   often end up selling "smoke"—overpromising results that engineers later struggle to deliver.
   This practice, they realized, conflicted with their core value of happiness.
   So, they eliminated the role entirely, ensuring engineers directly communicate with clients,
   aligning expectations with reality.

## Decisions by Consent
   One of the most fascinating practices at **10Pines** is their decision-making process.
   They avoid both consensus (too slow) and majority voting (which alienates minorities).
   Instead, they use **consent**. If one side feels strongly about a decision, they are allowed to proceed,
   with the understanding that the results will be revisited in three months.
   This approach fosters respect, experimentation, and collaboration.

## Trust Over Exploitation
   When the company allowed employees to choose their own health insurance plans,
   This could have been a "tragedy of the commons," where everyone would opt for the most expensive option.
   To his surprise, only three people selected it, presumably those with genuine need.
   This reinforced his faith in the inherent reasonableness and trustworthiness of people when given responsibility.

## Transparency in Pay
   **10Pines** operates as an open-book company.
   Salaries are public, and the pay structure is clear: the highest-paid employee earns 5.2 times what the lowest-paid employee earns.
   This transparency fosters fairness and eliminates the resentment that secrecy often breeds in traditional organizations.

## Projects as Learning Opportunities
   Projects at **10Pines** are structured to prioritize both quality and education.
   Each team includes at least one junior engineer, who works alongside seniors to learn what "good" looks like in practice.
   They charge by the team, not the level of individual contributors,
   ensuring that training the next generation of engineers is baked into their business model.

## Other things that surprised means

### We have an advantage because we are old

    Hernan told us that maturity is an advantage in this industry.
    So in in industry that is obsessed with young genious that was a refreshing take.

### How they split the profits.

### The last interview is with at least 20 people

    When they hire a new person they need to know that it is going to work well with the others.
    So the last interview is with 20 people.
    I think this also reflects a commitment with quality.
    I mean in the cooperative is they add a new person,
    That means they eare spliting their cake in more slices.
    So they need to know, that the new person will actually increase the size of the cake.

### Everyone is a programmer

    There are only two non-programmers in the company:
    * the acountant
    * the person in HR
    Apart from that very body else is a programmer.

### No project managers, no devops, no business analyst

    We are engineers,
    We know how to estimate a projec,
    (whhich is we don't ) because any estimate longer than 3 months is just guesssing.

    We are engineers,
    We should know how to manage a server.

    We are engineers,
    We know how to ask customers for their input.

# Challenges in a Democratic Company

Of course, running a democratically managed company is not without its challenges.
Hernán candidly shared two surprising experiences:

## Positive: Trust in Action

   Allowing employees to choose their insurance plans was a leap of faith that paid off.
   People chose responsibly, challenging the assumption that self-interest always leads to exploitation.

## Negative: Decision Paralysis

   When the company needed to let an employee go,
   the assembly—responsible for decision-making—took too long to act.
   The delay forced the founders to step in, highlighting
   the occasional need for executive authority in a predominantly democratic system.

## Legal entity incorporation

Although 10Pines is not legally incorporated as a cooperative
(primarily to avoid resistance from certain clients)
their operations embody cooperative principles.
There is a  temptation that can arise when companies receive acquisition offers,
a risk that formal cooperative incorporation might mitigate.

# Why 10Pines Doesn't Build Products

Interestingly, **10Pines** has not yet developed its own product.
Achieving product-market fit is one of the hardest challenges for any company.
Moreover, their natural inclination is to build tools for software engineers
a notoriously difficult market in which to achieve profitability.
For now, they focus on their core strength: delivering custom software with integrity and technical excellence.

# What people are saying.

  I have shared this conversation with many friends and this are their comments

> you can really tell that Hernan,
> is happy professionally
>   -- Karina Chaires

> Everything, you are saying
> sounds like the kind of place
> I would love to work on.
>  -- Mike Iñiguez



# Final Thoughts

Speaking with Hernán Wilkinson reminded me that cooperatives and democratically run businesses are not just idealistic experiments.
They are viable, effective, and deeply human ways to run a company.
By embedding values into every decision,
**10Pines** has created a workplace where happiness and excellence coexist.

My journey to Argentina—and this conversation in particular—has left me with a profound sense of possibility.
If a company can thrive without exploitation, without secrecy, and without sacrificing its principles,
then perhaps the future of work is brighter than we think.
