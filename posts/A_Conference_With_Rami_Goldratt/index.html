Today I had the privilege of attending a lecture by  Rami Goldratt.
Rami is son of Eli Goldratt; author of the Best Seller the Goal and the inventor of Theory of Constraints.

Rami's lecture was about the software solution for retail: https://1beat.com
It is the evolution of the solution of Theory of Constraints for Inventory Management.

Retail has 3 main challenges:

- Personalization
- Impatience
- Innovation

Let's examine this challenges in more detail.

# Retail Challenges

## Personalization

The number of products (SKUs) that chains has to carry has duplicated in only 3 years.
And more personalization begets more personalization
He showed the example of a retailer of sports with presence in Spain and Portugal.
And it went from 11000 SKUs in (2019) to 23000 SKUs in (2022).

## Impatience

Customers want the product right now.
They won't wait for reorder from another store, or another week to get it.
This means that you need to have more inventory of more SKUs

## More Innovation equals shorter product life cycles.

In the 80s how long could a TV be in the store and still sell it at full price?
3 years,
Now?
6 months... 3 months in Japan.
So that means we need to push new products to the stores.
But the stores already have too much inventory of too many SKUs so it is already full,
or if you put the new product side to side with the old one then it won't sell.

Given those challenges

# What is the solution?

## Protect the Dino.

- Protect the head
- Control the waist
- Chop the tail

![Dino aka a Pareto Distribution](dino.jpg)

## The Dino is the representation of a Pareto distribution

The head is the 20% of products that give you 80% of sales.
The waist are products that make the change of the curve.
And the tail are 80% of products that generate only the 20% of sales.

# How to implement the solution

## Protecting the head
Means measuring the speed and acceleration of sales.

The speed is calculated by measuring how many products are sold per unit of time.
For example: 3 books sold on monday means: 3 books / day.
2 books sold on tuesday means 2 books / day.

Acceleration is the rate of change between two speeds.

That is:
Final velocity - Initial Velocity / Time period.

In our example:

velocity of tuesday minus velocity on monday over 1 day of difference between the two.

(2 books / day - 3 books / day)  / 1 day = - 1 book / day squared.

That means sales are decelerating.
We don't need to replenish all the books.

In practice it means having dynamic points of reorder for the book, according to the tendencies in each specific store.

But those calculations, cannot be done by hand or excel.
Retailers require a software capable doing that in real time, for all the SKUs in all the stores.


## Chopping the tail
Means cut products that are losers across all stores
But we need to be very careful because.
In one company they found out that 15% of the long tail were the lovers in one store... but the best sellers in another.
Only 30% of long tail products were loser across all stores this are the ones that we must chop.
But it is only 30% of the 80% long tail... so that is only 24% of the total.

## What are my conclusions?

- I'm happy that I came to the talk
- This knowledge is going to be in book form in a few years but now I have it now that is going to start#
- Even Goldratt found that he needed to sale a software product to scale#
- We must create the smart Kanban board. Which would be the evolution of the TOC solution for project management.

But most importantly:

> I got to tell Rami,
> that I loved his father Eli
> That he was a light in this world of conflict.
> and that we really need him.
