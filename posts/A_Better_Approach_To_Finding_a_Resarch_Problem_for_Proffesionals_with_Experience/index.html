# A better approach to finding research problems for experienced professionals
By Alejandro Garc√≠a, and Pepe Hernandez. January 17th, 2025

When discussing research, particularly in the context of Mexico, a prevailing mindset is that the starting point must be identifying a gap in the literature. A recent trend named bibliometric analysis is an example of this mindset. However, this approach doesn't always align with practical, impactful research. This kind of applied research is conducted in developed countries. Here's a fresh perspective on tackling useful and impactful research problems, inspired by a recent discussion between Alex, Jani, and me last weekend.

## A Different Starting Point for Research
The process often starts with a personal or industry problem in countries where research drives practical innovation. The mindset shifts from merely filling a gap in academic literature to addressing real-world challenges. Here's how this alternative process unfolds:

### Step 1. Identify the Problem:
This approach comes from someone with experience in a practical field. For example:
- An engineer might ask, "How do I build a solution to this problem I know, I saw, I already have, or as an organization I discovered?"
- Meanwhile, a scientist with no practical experience could inquire, "What has been done written before about this area of interest? and what are the existing challenges?"

### Step 2. Explore the Landscape:
The following steps involve framing the problem within the existing body of knowledge. Depending on the findings, researchers can proceed in several ways:

- **The problem has already been solved and documented**: Great! You've found your answer. Document your application as a case study to enrich the literature.
- **The solution exists in another field**: Adapt and apply it to your domain. Then, write about your experience of cross-domain implementation.
- **You have a new solution**: Develop your innovation and contribute to the knowledge pool with your unique approach.
- **The problem is recognized, but no solution exists**: This is a major opportunity. Put on your engineering hat and create a solution, even if it's a first iteration.
- **The problem isn't recognized in the literature**: This requires a deeper look. You've uncovered a novel issue (potential innovation!) or need to refine your search terms to verify its uniqueness.

## The new trendy academic approach to finding a Problem: the Bibliometric Analysis
Another emerging method to look for impactful research topics is bibliometric analysis. This approach uses statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze scientific literature, uncover trends, and define potential lines of inquiry. Key indicators include:

- Publications per year
- Most-cited works
- Author productivity
- Gender or language trends in authorship

Using this method, researchers can pivot from broad trends to pinpoint specific problems worth addressing, especially for students or those without extensive industry experience.

## The Bigger Picture: Useful Research Drives Innovation
These insights emphasize a critical point: impactful research often emerges from practical problems, not abstract gaps in the literature. This shift in mindset aligns research more closely with real-world applications, making it more relevant and valuable.

## A refinement of the approach in BPM format.
