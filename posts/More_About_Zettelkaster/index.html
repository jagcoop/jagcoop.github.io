By Pepe Hernandez. January 26th, 2025.

The author of Zettlekasten is Niklas Luhmann (+70 books, 400 academic articles).His Zettlekaste contained over 90,000 ideas. Very good. "Even after his deaths, his ideas were combined to write MORE BOOKS!!"

Zettelkasten means "slip box" of "box of cards".
Each slip or card represent a SINGLE, ATOMIC IDEA that makes sense by ITSELF, and also in combination with other ideas.

Luhman credited his achievements to his Zettelkasten, which contained over 90,000 ideas that helped him develop topics by knitting together ideas into a cohesive whole. His books wrote themselves, idea by idea (even after his death, his ideas could be combined to publish more books on his behalf).

Permanente notes are written in the context of YOUR IDEAS AND INTERSTS.
Literature notes must contain a SINGLE IDEA on each page.
The moment you BIND TWO IDEAS they lose the ability to insert ne ideas between them.
