# A new approach for generating products: to publish small products in less than two weeks.
By Pepe Hernandez, Januar 19th, 2025.

## The ROVIO style. Repeat until you have success (From 1 to 52 to arrive at Angry Birds).

In the past, we worked on big and long-term projects.
We learned a lot from different perspectives.
However, those ideas ultimately died, and we don't have any products that generate passive income.
The Lean Startup Approach emphasizes looking for problems, pain points, and jobs to be done. In summary, it's about identifying opportunities and transforming them into products.
How many ideas do we need to be successful?
ROVIO developed 51 games before creating Angry Birds.
"This remarkable story underscores the crucial lesson for every entrepreneur: success rarely happens overnight. It takes dedication, resilience, and the willingness to experiment, even when faced with countless rejections."

## We need to develop projects faster.
Since our past projects took months or even years, we must take a different approach.
Using Coding Skills to Generate Passive Income
Alex found this conference: "Using coding skills to generate passive income".
It tells the story of Corey Zue, a South African developer who quit his job as CTO of a startup to become an indie product developer.

Among the products he developed are:
- SaaS Pegasus
- Scriv
- PlaceCard Me
- Photos New Tab
- SaaS Starters
- Chat Stats

Corey Zue is now earning more passive income than he did as a CTO.

Alex, Arturo, Karina, and Toño talked with Hernán Wilkinson, founder of Ten Pines, a well-known software cooperative in Argentina. Among other things, Alex asked Hernan about why he is not creating software products but selling software services (outsourcing). Wilkinson shared his perspective:
	"I can only think of products for software developers. And if one 				group doesn't like paying, it's software developers."

Ten Pines focuses on offering software development services to other companies. They haven't ventured into developing software products, believing it's nearly impossible to monetize products aimed at software developers.

Less than a month later, Alex discovered Corey Zue's conference about getting money selling products to developers. Alex changed his mind:
It is possible to sell software products to developers.
We need to accelerate the speed of our experiments.
How can we arrive at this mythical 52nd (following the ROVIO principle: do it until you have success) product and have success? 

Developing smaller products is the way.

## More Inspiration
Another insight came from a Stack Overflow blog post. It featured hundreds of software product projects generating over $500 per month. This reinforced Alex's belief that such success is achievable.

## A List of Ideas
Last Tuesday, Juan, Leo, Alex, and I reunited to discuss some product ideas for Jag Cooperative. I am adding a smaller list here.
- A JSON Resume for Teams
- A solution using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to compare different ideas (see Leonel's thesis).
- Open Badges
- Blockchaing certificate services for independent course makers
- NFT certificates for artwork
- Flow Metrics software
- A GitHub interface with SSH support
- A GitHub Configuration Management Tool
- Photoinvoicing
- Banking core software (similar to Mambu)
- Personal accounting software for independent workers
- Criteria for Developing New Products

## Guidelines for choosing among ideas
When considering new products, we should adhere to the following guidelines:
- Focus on tools close to the command line (e.g., Text-to-Something tools like SketchMiner). See Alex's blog post on Text-to-X tools: Awesome List of Text-to-X.

Note. This is a draft. I hope a historical draft of the future of Jac.Coop.
