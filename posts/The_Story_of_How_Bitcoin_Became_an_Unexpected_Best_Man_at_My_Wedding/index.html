# The Story of How Bitcoin Became an Unexpected Best Man at My Wedding

**April 2014:** Bitcoin was trading at a modest $350. At the time, I was in the first year of my master’s program in Software Engineering, completely unaware that a weekend project that month would eventually pay for a significant part of my wedding years later.

This is the story of how a weekend of coding, friends, and a little-known cryptocurrency turned into one of the most unexpected contributors to my "happily ever after."

## The Project: Building a Trading System in Record Time

It all started when we received an intriguing project: to build a trading system for a private client. The idea was to capitalize on price differences between two trading platforms, buying on the cheaper one and selling on the more expensive one. The ultimate goal was to convert all profits into dollars to reflect clear financial gains for the client.
The challenge was ambitious, but I wasn’t alone. Together with my master’s classmates **Antonio** and **Francisco**, a few friends like **Agustín**, and our professor **Alejandro**, we tackled the task. Over a single intense weekend, fueled by coffee and determination, we delivered a fully functional system.
**The reward?** Around $30,000 pesos, paid not in cash but in **4 bitcoins**.

## Bitcoin in 2014: A Novelty, Not an Investment

Back in 2014, Bitcoin was far from the financial powerhouse it is today. Accepting payment in cryptocurrency felt more like a fun experiment than a strategic decision. Those 4 bitcoins were stored in a wallet under Agustín’s name, forgotten as we moved on with our lives—classes, exams, and new projects.

## Fast Forward to 2018: Rediscovering the Wallet

Four years later, in 2018, I was in a completely different chapter of life: planning my wedding. Between scouting venues, choosing menus, and calculating costs, I got a call from Agustín. Excitedly, he reminded us of the wallet from our project and said it was time to split the funds.
To my amazement, those **4 bitcoins**, which were worth around $30,000 pesos in 2014, had significantly appreciated. My share was enough to cover **one-third of my wedding costs**.
That year, I even dabbled in some trading, increasing my initial amount by an additional **10%**. Every extra peso contributed to creating a memorable day.

## Bitcoin: The Most Unexpected Best Man

What began as a weekend project turned into a unique anecdote. That payment, which initially seemed like a quirky tech experiment, ended up funding a significant part of one of the most important days of my life.
Now, every time I look back on my wedding, I think about all the pieces that made it possible: my family, my friends... and of course, **Bitcoin**, my most unexpected best man.

## Reflection

This experience taught me two valuable lessons:
1. **The power of technology and innovation.** Bitcoin, which was once seen as a novelty, has become a financial tool with real-world impact.
2. **The value of small decisions.** Accepting Bitcoin as payment in 2014 might have seemed trivial at the time, but it turned out to be one of the best financial decisions of my life.

What about you? What unexpected surprises has technology brought into your life? Perhaps you, too, already have a "best man" waiting in your future.
