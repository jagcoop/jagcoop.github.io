     ** How to show different perspectives for the same information **

November 21st, 2024

As I have said in my previous post:
I love this image:

![multiple perspectives](./shadow_cube_cas.jpg)

It shows that the same object can be seen from multiple perspectives.

So for several years now I have been trying to find:

In this post I'm going to explain the different ways I have tried to solve this problem.

## Text to Diagrams.

Let's first start with two representations of the same idea:
Text and diagrams.

Here we have PlantUML text:

``` plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: Another authentication Response
@enduml
```

And it generates this diagram:

![Plantuml](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/SoWkIImgAStDuNBCoKnELT2rKt3AJx9IS2mjoKZDAybCJYp9pCzJ24ejB4qjBk42oYde0jM05MDHLLoGdrUSoeLkM5u-K5sHGY9MGw6ARNHryQb66EwGcfS2T300)

Observe how brief the text to create the diagram is.
And at the same time observe that the diagram is more understandable than the text
used to create it.

I have a collection of tools like this:

https://elviejo79.github.io//2020-02-02-Awesome-list-of-text-to-X/

So in general I love this kinds of tools.
My only problems are so far:
1. I cannot create DSL to create any kind of language I want so that it creates a diagram.
2. I wish that the text to generate the diagrams where actual code.

### For diagrams that are actual code.

We have programming languages like https://ballerina.io
That given this code,
 that is executable

``` java

import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/googleapis.sheets;

configurable string githubPAT = ?;
configurable string repository = "ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang";
configurable string sheetsAccessToken = ?;
configurable string spreadSheetId = ?;
configurable string sheetName = "pull-requests";

type PR record {
    string url;
    string title;
    string state;
    string created_at;
    string updated_at;
};

public function main() returns error? {
    http:Client github = check new ("https://api.github.com/repos");
    map<string> headers = {
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
        "Authorization": "token " + githubPAT
    };
    PR[] prs = check github->/[repository]/pulls(headers);

    sheets:Client gsheets = check new ({auth: {token: sheetsAccessToken}});
    _ = check gsheets->appendValue(spreadSheetId, ["Issue", "Title", "State", "Created At", "Updated At"],
                {sheetName: sheetName});

    foreach var {url, title, state, created_at, updated_at} in prs {
        _ = check gsheets->appendValue(spreadSheetId, [url, title, state, created_at, updated_at],
                    {sheetName: sheetName});
    }
}
```

will generate this diagram:

![Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/images/consuming-services-diagram.svg)

Now this is a powerful programming language for cloud services.

However my problem is that it's only for that kind of system and only sequence diagram.

I want to crate any kind of diagram, with DSL.

### For creating a DSL that has concepts

The most user friendly ways that I have found to generate DSL are

#### Small-talk

#### Scroll notation

#### White-space lisp

#### Racket

# Ontologies and RDFa

Triplets

Wikidata

SPRQL

# lisp and homo-iconic languages

# Bidirectional parsers

Bidirectional parsers are an extremely interesting concept.

In most programming languages, the Parser and the Pretty Printer are developed independently.
So that means that if your parsers translate a Source Code file .Ne a Long String.
Into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Which is a tree data structure.
And then you print the AST (data structure)
What gets printer is NOT code that compiles.

But having the pretty print code to be compilable is attractive.
Because that way we can more easily build debuggers, or even transpiler.

The idea is that we have the two functions:

get
: takes a source code and returns an abstract syntax tree

	source_code_v1 |> get |> AST

put
: takes an AST and returns a source code

  AST |> put |> source_code_v2

but we need to clarify that source_code_v2 and source_code_v1 are not the same but they are equivalent.
which means that generating the AST from both versions must generate the same AST

	(source_code_v1 |> put) == (source_code_v2 |> put)

Now the problem is that given an AST there is almost an infinite number of possible source_code representations:
for example

  if (A == 1) and (B == 2) then ...

could as easily be represented by

  if (B == 2) and (A == 1) then ...

  or even more difficult

	if (A == 1) then {
		if ( == 2 ) then ...
	}

with a nested if.
So we we have the problem that the _put_ function can have "infinite outputs.
that's why the creators of BiGUL
Created a third function called _put-back_

	put-back(source_code_v1, AST_modified) and produce source_code_v2

So in put-back the parameters are the original source code that you started with, the AST that it generates,
that can or cannot be modified and then outputs source_code_v2.
Since now we have two pieces of data we can actually generate a single deterministic output for put-back.

And that makes all the difference.
