# The Illusion of Averages: Personalized Diets, Brexit Realities, and Global Political Shifts**
By Alejandro Garcia, and Pepe Hernandez. March 5th, 2025

The JAG.coop has a non-agenda meeting, every tuesday from 11 to 12 o clock. More o less. Every meeting is a "tertulia", very interesting topics arise. It is optional for members, but almost ever Alex, and I attend to the meeting. Agus, and Juan ara non frequent guests. The others have attended sometime in the history. Everybody is invited, but just a few are constant at the meetings. 

This are the topic touched today. Result of the meeting: a business idea, and reminder about contundence of reality.

------------------------------------------------------------

### **The Problem with Averages and Personalized Diets**

A recent documentary by Deutsche Welle (DW) https://youtu.be/YAmzlo5pbN8?si=3ZiOVNBuok6hIpBN tackled the issue of glycemic index and how conventional dietary guidelines are based on averages that do not account for individual metabolic differences. The study they presented measured how 100 grams of sugar affected blood glucose levels and then compared it with the effect of different types of food, such as bread. The key takeaway? **Averages can be misleading.**

For some participants, eating bread raised their blood sugar levels by only 20 points, whereas others experienced spikes. Yet, when averaged, the effect of bread was reported as a 90-point increase, which is not an accurate representation for any single individual. This highlights a crucial reality: **bodies react differently to food, and a one-size-fits-all dietary approach is flawed.**

Recognizing this problem, a German doctor developed a **personalized diet protocol** aimed at tailoring nutritional recommendations based on individual responses to food. His approach is simple yet effective:

1. **Record everything you eat for a month.**
2. **Follow a controlled breakfast prescribed by the doctor.**
3. **If you are still hungry after breakfast, eat whatever you feel like.**
4. **At the end of the month, analyze the collected data to determine which foods significantly spike blood sugar and should be avoided.**

Patients wear a continuous glucose monitor for a month, logging meals and their corresponding effects on blood sugar levels. Based on this data, the doctor customizes diet plans, offering a scientific, data-driven approach to nutrition.

This idea could be a service, where users simply photograph their meals and track their blood glucose levels. The concept hints at the future of **AI-driven, personalized dietary plans** that could revolutionize nutrition and healthcare by replacing generic advice with precise, individualized recommendations.

### **The Brexit Fantasy and Its Reality Check**

Moving from personal health to political health, an economist and UK-based blogger—who has been closely followed since Brexit—recently made a powerful statement:

> *“The fantasy of Brexit won at the ballot box, but the fantasy of Brexit loses against the reality of Brexit.”*

This observation encapsulates how ideological movements often triumph in elections based on grand promises but falter when confronted with real-world consequences. Brexit was sold as a vision of sovereignty and economic freedom, yet years later, the UK is struggling with economic stagnation, trade disruptions, and labor shortages.

The same principle applies to **MAGA (Make America Great Again).** The professor extends his analysis, arguing:

> *“The MAGA fantasy won at the ballot box, but the MAGA fantasy loses against reality. It will take years for its supporters to recognize the disastrous consequences.”*

This pattern is familiar: political movements often rally support through emotional appeals, yet their policies eventually face the inescapable test of **economic and geopolitical realities.** The delay between decision and consequence allows leaders to deflect blame, but eventually, **reality asserts itself.**

### **Geopolitical Reactions: Economic Retaliation Against Trump States**

As global politics shift, nations are strategizing how to deal with potential Trump policies. European leaders are considering economic countermeasures that would specifically target states that overwhelmingly supported Trump in past elections.

One proposed tactic: **imposing 100% tariffs on products from Trump-voting states.** This would make goods from these regions significantly more expensive in international markets, causing economic strain on industries that rely on exports.

For example:
- **American beer** could face high tariffs, driving European distributors to favor local or non-U.S. brands.
- **Municipal-level boycotts** are already emerging, with some stores actively removing U.S. products from shelves.
- **Ontario, Canada, supplies electricity to 1.6 million Americans**. While currently a hypothetical scenario, there have been discussions about the possibility of cutting power supply temporarily as a symbolic response to U.S. policies.

These retaliatory strategies reflect a growing recognition that economic power can be used as a political tool. Unlike traditional military conflicts, **economic warfare** allows countries to exert influence without direct confrontation.

### **The State of the Union and Symbolic Resistance**

The annual **State of the Union Address** in the United States is a critical moment for the sitting president to outline policies and rally support. However, this year’s address was met with increasing discontent from international observers.

A particularly striking idea floated online was a form of symbolic protest: **Ontario cutting power for five minutes** to signal dissatisfaction with U.S. political directions. While largely hypothetical, such actions underscore a larger trend: **the world is watching, and it is willing to respond.**

### **Conclusion: The Role of Reality in Decision-Making**

Whether it’s in **personal health, political movements, or international trade**, the **gap between fantasy and reality** is a recurring theme.

- **In health**, we are learning that **personalized data-driven decisions** outperform generalized averages.
- **In politics**, ideological movements can win elections, but they inevitably **collide with economic and social realities**.
- **In global relations**, nations are realizing that **economic leverage can be just as powerful as military strength**.

The question we must ask is: **How long will it take for people to listen to reality rather than ideology?** The faster individuals, governments, and institutions adapt to **what actually works**, the better the outcomes will be.

---

### **Final Thought: Measuring, Adapting, and Acting**

Much like how a German doctor’s glucose-monitoring protocol tailors diets to individual needs, **nations and political leaders must learn to measure outcomes accurately and adjust policies accordingly**. Fantasy-driven decisions may win votes, but only **data-driven adaptations** will ensure long-term success.

The challenge remains: **How long will we take to acknowledge reality?**
