# How to Innovate on the Water Scarcity Issue from Your Position?
By Pepe Hernández, December 24th 2024.

Water scarcity worldwide is critical. The United Nations website, in its section on global challenges, provides some alarming statistics worth mentioning:

2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services. Among them, 771 million cannot access even basic drinking water services.
Improved water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions could prevent around 400,000 deaths annually from diarrheal diseases among children under five.
80% of wastewater returns to the ecosystem untreated or unreused (UN Water, 2018).
In Mexico, the situation is not much different. Mexico ranks as the fifth-highest consumer of water per capita in the world. Of the water consumed, 14% goes to human use, 76% to agriculture, 5% to thermoelectric plants, and 5% to industry, according to the national statistics and geography institute.

This crisis is further exacerbated by climate change and the intense heat and solar radiation experienced in 2024.

The Current Drought Situation in Mexico
The following is Mexico's Drought Monitor as of May 15, 2024. It clearly shows that very few areas of the country are drought-free (gray zones). The rest face varying degrees of drought.

Maroon indicates exceptional drought, and red indicates extreme drought.
A significant part of the territory in Sinaloa, Sonora, Chihuahua, and Durango is experiencing exceptional drought.
Similarly, San Luis Potosí, Veracruz, Puebla, and Guanajuato are also facing extreme conditions.

Recent events, such as the water scarcity crisis in Nuevo León in 2022, where residents and industries faced daily cuts, and potential water rationing in Mexico City, underscore the growing importance of Sustainable Water Management.

Learning from Global Leaders: Israel's Water Management
Following the TRIZ principle—"Why reinvent the wheel?"—we must ask: Has someone else in the world already solved this problem? The answer is yes. Israel is a global leader in this area.

Israel has achieved a remarkable feat: producing 20% more water than it consumes, despite its desert-dominated climate. If Israel succeeded, can we achieve the same? How did Israel become self-sufficient in water generation?

Here's a brief summary of Israel's water management journey:

1964: Israel began constructing a National Water Carrier, sourcing water from the Sea of Galilee.
1964: Israeli scientists invented drip irrigation, allowing less water to be allocated to crops. By 1965, 75% of crops were irrigated this way, although only natural freshwater sources were used.
Mid-1980s: 82% of the water supply was used for agriculture.
1985: Recycled water was incorporated into the National Water Carrier.
1986: 85% of recycled water was dedicated to agriculture.
1999-2015: Israel built five desalination plants.
With 273 km of Mediterranean coastline, these plants have a combined capacity of 597 million cubic meters annually. Two additional plants, with a combined capacity of 300 million cubic meters, are under construction.
The Sorek plant, operated by IDE Technologies, is Israel's most important desalination facility and employs reverse osmosis technology. IDE Technologies has over 4,000 desalination plants in 40 countries.
Cultural and Governmental Efforts
2009: The government launched a campaign featuring celebrities like supermodel Bar Refaeli, filmmakers, and athletes, promoting responsible water consumption. As a result, consumption dropped by 16%.
Over time, desalinated, recycled, and harvested water have diversified water sources. Excess desalinated water is now returned to the Sea of Galilee.
Efforts to protect and restore rivers and aquifers continue as part of their strategy.
Lessons for Mexico
A national vision for water sustainability and focused water management projects are essential. In the near future, water will become a matter of national security, as it is in Israel.

For vulnerable groups in Mexico, the stakes are even higher: approximately 95,000 children under five die annually from consuming contaminated water, and only 52% of the population receives daily access to potable water (Aristegui Noticias, 2019).

How Can We Help Vulnerable Communities?
The nonprofit organization Litro x Litro presented a proposal on Shark Tank: for every water book they sell, they donate one water book to vulnerable areas. This initiative is their way of addressing the issue, one small step at a time.
