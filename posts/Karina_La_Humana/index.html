# Unlocking the Power of Personal Cloud

In today’s world, increasingly digital and virtualized, it’s easy to lose touch with our human essence. We find ourselves caught in a routine of screens and notifications, where real moments of connection are often overshadowed by the constant immediacy of digital life. However, there are moments that bring us back to our humanity, reminding us of the beauty of the tangible and the natural—like a breath of fresh air that reconnects us with who we truly are.

Not long ago, while working in front of a beautiful sunset in Argentina&rsquo;s Patagonia, I felt a deep sense of gratitude for the privilege of experiencing such a moment. This connection, so intimate and pure with nature, reminded me of the importance of preserving these physical spaces in a world that is increasingly immersed in the virtual. We are beginning to lose our sense of the space in which our lives unfold, without clearly distinguishing between what is real and what is digital. For me, without a doubt, physical places and moments will always hold the most value.

This reflection on the importance of the physical goes beyond landscapes; it also extends to our interactions and human connections. A few months ago, I had the opportunity to teach a programming course in Buenos Aires, Argentina. There, I met passionate people who are part of programming communities and local cooperatives. These conversations, which went beyond technical aspects and became human encounters, were enriched by sharing barbecues, walks, and ice cream. These moments, so simple yet so full of life, reminded me that nothing can replace the power of a face-to-face conversation. No technology can emulate the warmth of a shared smile, the tone of spontaneous laughter, or the feeling of presence.

It’s true that time is a resource we increasingly value, and we seek to optimize it to do more in less time. Virtual meetings and digital tools help us save time, but, paradoxically, this time-saving is distancing us from real moments of connection.

This is why I invite everyone to pause now and then, to disconnect from the
virtual and immerse themselves in the world around us. To share a face-to-face
conversation over a good cup of coffee, or simply go for a walk and breathe.
These moments of connection remind us of our essence and bring us back to our
humanity. In a world quickly moving toward the digital, perhaps the most
valuable thing we can do is rediscover the richness of the physical, of the
human, and give it the place it deserves in our lives.
