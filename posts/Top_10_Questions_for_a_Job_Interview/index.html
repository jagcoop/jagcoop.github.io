By Pepe Hernandez. December 11th, 2024

## Moster Lists for top 10 questions
Interviewers use common questions. Here is a list of 10 common questions and some tips for answering them (from an Article by Moster). Be prepared and practice.

1. **What are your weaknesses?** Concentrate on professional qualities and minimize your weaknesses
2. **Why should we hire you?** Summarize your experience.
3. **Why do you want to work here?** It looks for knowledge about the company.
4. **What are your goals?** Your immediate and medium term goals.
5. **Why did you leave, or why are you leaving) your job?** Give some context and answer.
6. What can you do for us that other candidates can't? Mention the valuable (someone can pay for that) or rare skills that differentiate you from the others.
7. When were you most satisfied with your job? Where you find motivation.
8. What would your last boss say three positive things about you? Brag in other people words.
9. What salary are your seeking? Research previously to be inside the range or say you would adapt to the wages if they can tell you the range.
10. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be? Do not think of passive or aggressive animals. Look for a good answer.

The best way to answer a question is to be prepared for the response. Answer these questions, record yourself, and keep practicing.

## Don Georgovich list
The following is a list of the top 10 common questions from Don's experience:

1. Tell me about yourself. Talk about your career journey. Where have you come from and what have you achieved? A maximum of a minute.
2. Why are you the best person for the position? Please explain how you can help the company, your understanding of the business, and similar solutions to their problems. 
3. What are your skills. 
4. Your main weakness. I get frustrated when things are delivered late.
5. Why do you want to work here? Culture, the pople, the possibilitiesâ€¦
6. Why did you quit your last job?
7. Mention a complex problem and what you did?
8. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
9. Do you have any questions? What are the primary skills of the positions, what are the goals of the positions, and what is a good fit for this position

Exercise:
I have done that exercise several times since I applied for jobs many times after the pandemic and after the tech sector's debacle in 2022. Each time, I related the position's requirements to the top common questions and created a matrix where I could establish a relationship to check if I was covering all the skills needed for the position. 

Try it. You will feel prepared.
