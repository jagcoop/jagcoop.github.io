# A Review of Kanban Simulations In Education
By Pepe Hernandez. March 4th, 2025.

The GetKanban Game, is the standard simulation board game to teach Kanban. The Kanban Community includes it in the Kanban Trainings (https://getkanban.com/). That is the case of the GetKanban Game as part of the Kanban System Design training. A certified training from Kanban University (https://kanban.university/kanban-development-path/).  A questions, arises with the use of this type of serios games, and simulations. Using simulations is an effective way to teach Kanban? 

## Scrum, and Kanban
Scrum is widely used in the world than Kanban. Both Kanban, and Scrum were considered agile methodologies at the beginning. Both communities had specified what is the true nature of each of one in their respective description guides. "Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.(Scrum Guide 2020, https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)", while Kanban is a "Management Method" (The Kanban Guide, https://kanban.university/kanban-guide/).

## Academic research about effectiveness in Kanban Serious Games 
While the Get Kanban board game is a product that you can buy online in Get Kanban Game webpage, the version 2 is available to download and print. 
In order to know if the Get Kanban game, and simulations embedded in serious games are effective there is some scientific research.
* Heikkilä, a finish academic researcher, create a modified version of the Ge Kanban Game and played with students of software engineering in order to revise the effectiveness. Heikkilä discover that students were very positive about the game. Students perceived they had learned a lot with playing. In reality students only reached the learning goals partially.

## Academic research for effectiveness in Scrum Serious Games
Gordillo in 2024, examines the effectiveness of applying a Lego Serious Play activity, and a Virtual Reality Serious Game with students of Software Engineering and found that both activities are effective. 
In a second study, López-Fernández, Gordillo, et al compares LEGO Serious Play Activity with traditional lecture in software engineering. They found that the use of LSP activities not only improve learning but motivation among the students. 

Udeozor, et al 2022, Karakok et al 2020, Tokac et al, 2019, Hussen el tal, 2019, Boyle et al, 2016, Hainey et al, 2017, and Bodnar et al, 2016. All of them agrees about effectiveness of serios games in simulations.

## **Why similar studies about serious games have different results about effectiveness?**

One possible bias from Heikkilä refers to only one reference study that talks about this positive perception of the students, but low effectiveness in learning (Paasivaara et al, 2014).

## Additional Insights:
* The paper of Gordillo is published in the MDPI website. This is important, because it talks about how serious games is a popular topic for developing*
## Other case studies
There are other experiences, in the application of the Kanban Method, and in general of Project Management using simulation:
* Miller, and Vaca present the "Project Wing Game", a serious game to teach agile and traditional project management*.
* Gonzales Pacheco, et al, proposed a library of Kanban Serious games to teach Kanban to SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises).
* Salza et al, made a Literature Review about applying agile methodologies in educations*.
* Silveria explored the creation of game boards to teach soft skills for students of Human Computer Interactions.
