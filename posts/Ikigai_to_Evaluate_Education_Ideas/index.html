# Ikigai. A Japanese concept to evaluate  new challenges in education
By Pepe Hernández, November 21th, 2024

## The Public Health System service created a significant opportunity for low-cost health services in Mexico 
The public health system in Mexico has many inefficiencies. Each company that hires employees must contribute to the National Health Security System, allowing workers to access IMSS services. However, the service needs to be improved for all beneficiaries. Its quality has deteriorated over time and has increased due to public policies implemented during the López Obrador administration. Medicines and drugs are included in the public service. To book a medical appointment, individuals must physically visit the facility in the early morning, present their Social Security card, and line up until their turn occurs. Sometimes, the wait can last all day.

Several pharmacy chains, such as Dr. Simi, Farmacias del Ahorro, and Benavides, have identified an opportunity. These pharmacies have established foundations to provide low-cost medical consultations next to their branches. For approximately USD 2.50 (50 Mexican pesos), patients can access medical services with the option to give an additional tip to the doctor. Most medicines sold are generic, making them cheaper than those large pharmaceutical companies produce. This business model enables people to access essential healthcare services affordably. 

## A low-cost primary education service, the "Simi-school".
Given the success of this model, why not apply it to basic education? In Mexico, public education is another low-quality service. Private education, which is also available, is expensive. Why not establish something like a "Simi School," similar to Dr. Simi's model?

Alejandro Garcia came up with this idea. As usual, Alex shared his thoughts with us. Last week, He discussed the concept with Carlos Lara, the Chair of CIMAT, Zacatecas. He was enthusiastic about it. 

Alex agreed it was a good idea but believed it would be better suited for someone else to execute. Why?

## A Simi School and the Ikigai Framework
The Ikigai framework, a Japanese concept, evaluates purpose through four dimensions:
- What you love
- What the world needs
- What you are good at
- What you can be paid for

In the case of a "Simi School," Alex and his team realized they were not qualified for the "what you are good at" dimension. Their expertise lies in high school, higher education, and vocational training, not primary education.

As a result, Alex proposed a variation: they might not be able to create a "Simi School for primary education," but they could establish a "Simi School for Software Engineering postgraduate level."

## Ikigai: A Gradual Evaluation
While Ikigai is often seen as binary, it can also be understood as a gradient. For example:
- "Yes, I'll be paid for it, but only a little."
- "The world needs it, but not urgently."
- "I am good at it, but not excellent."
Visualizing Ikigai as a gradient allows for more nuanced decisions.

## Applying Ikigai to Alex's Passion
Alex loves education, creating programming languages, and discovering suitable paradigms. He's read extensively about successful programming language developers but noticed many, like those behind Elm or Eiffel, make little money. While Alex loves this work, is good at it, and sees its value, the world isn't willing to pay for it at scale.

Conversely, some pursuits fit all dimensions but lack meaning—for instance, high-frequency trading, which is lucrative, necessary, and skillful but serves no larger purpose.

## With our expertise, we can find another opportunity in education following the Simi-School idea?
Alex and Carlos identified that software engineering education is a potential area aligning with their expertise. Specifically, they considered:
- Master's programs focused on programming transitions and interdisciplinary approaches.
- A Master's Degree emphasizing programming paradigms, requiring students to write 100,000 lines of code (LOC) by graduation—a benchmark for strong beginners.

## We are already on the Sw Engineering Domain. Is it possible an interest conflict?
Carlos reassured Alex that there would be no conflict of interest if he continued teaching at his university while pursuing this venture. Inspired by the Escuela Libre de Derecho—a prestigious law school established by rejected UNAM professors—Alex envisioned creating a similar institution in software engineering. The CIMAT Software Engineering Degree is for full-time students, and they need to be software engineers, or at least have some experience in this area. The proposed Master's Degrees are for non-software engineers who want to become software engineers. And, for a very specialized software engineer who wants to write software. The CIMAT Software Engineering is focused on process improvement, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

## Feed for thought
After these rolling coaster of ideas, I have a pair of insights:
- I must reflect about the several things I am doing. The Ikigai is a good frame to think.
- A new idea can be evaluated under this framework. Then we can go ahead, or not.
- There is an opportunity for us in Software Engineering education.
