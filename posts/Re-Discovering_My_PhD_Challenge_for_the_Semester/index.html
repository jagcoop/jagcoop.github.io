# An Agendashift Exercise for Planning my PhD semester
By Pepe Hernandez. December 31th, 2024

## What is Agendashift
Agendashift started as a change management model, and in reality, it is a change management model, but it is also a different type of model. It is an engagement model. It can help at every scope and every level to “develop strategy **together**, pursuing strategy **together**, put outcomes before solutions, working backward (from right to left) from key moments of impact and learning.”

Agendashift is a framework created by Mike Burrows. He started as an IT professional who worked on IT and innovation projects for the government of the UK. Then he became an evangelist of Kanban, a consultant, and an author; he wrote Kanban from the Inside, Agendashif, Right to Left, and Agendashift 2, and is currently working on another book project. And now, his framework is a reference in the change management area. You can see more details in Agendashift

Agendashift uses generative patterns, operating on and through an agenda for change. The two patterns are:
IdOO (Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes)
Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment

I have used it several times. I use it to help small companies scale. I use it to discover new ways to be more efficient and achieve a more significant impact on teams. I have used it to find company challenges and create an appropriate conversation environment.

Now, I am using this for personal purposes. Advance in my PhD. I have a big challenge this semester, starting with Agendashift.

Agendashift has five core activities:
1. Discovery. I want to understand where I would like to go this semester.
2. Exploration. Identify opportunities for change, exploring outcomes in more depth.
3. Mapping. Visualizing plans, priorities, understanding relationships between outcomes
4. Elaboration. Options were generated, framed as hypotheses, and experiments were developed, keeping the change process fed with ideas and informed by results and experience.e
5. Operation. The organizational infrastructure required for change.

In this exercise, I will develop the **Discovery** core activity.

The following exercises are needed for the **Discovery** core activity:
- Celebration-5W
- A two-part True North exercise: Ideal, then Obstacles
- Good Obstacle, Bad Obstacle (I let this for another post)
- Practice Outcomes
- 15-Minute FOTO (Lite)
- Plan on a Page

- What: Systematic Literature Review sent
- Who: Pao, My Children, My Parents, Siblings, Viejo, Jani.
- Where: Mérida / Zacatecas (two events). Online.
- When: January 31st, 2025
- Why: It's a life challenge. There is a commitment. If I don't finish by now, the debt will ascend to 360,000 MXN pesos. It is growing 20k pesos per month.

##The True North
This is like a Change Agent credo of the Agendashift framework. We accept that there always is a better way to work. It also reminds me of the concept of Ideality from TRIZ. Ideality is the utopic system or state with infinite benefits, zero costs, and zero undesired effects. The following text is the True North credo...

	“Imagine...

	Everyone able to work consistently at their ideal best:
	Individuals, teams, between teams, across the organization and beyond
	Right conversations, right people, best possible moment
	Needs anticipated, met at just the right time

	https://www.agendashift.com/true-north.”

Agendashift framework uses three questions so you can relate the True North: “Everyone (You), be able to work consistently at their (Yours) ideal best...”  The intent is to answer the questions with familiar stories to bring to the surface moments where you perform at your highest (as a person)...

### Question 1: What's that like when that’s working at its ideal best for us?
My first story concerns the one-week divulgation article sent for an IEEE proceedings magazine. I participated in the CIMPs (13th International Conference on Software Process Improvement 2024)  realized in Mérida, Yucatán. I participated in facilitating a Workshop with two physical simulations to teach Flow Systems. This is an academic invitation. When you participate and donate your time and effort, you have the right to send an article for free for publication in the IEEE proceedings magazine of the symposium. I didn't know that. So, I wrote an article about one of the two simulations in three days. There were two reviewers of the article. Alex that is also a Kanban Trainer. And Alejandra Romero, who is currently part of my PhD committee.  In just one week, we had an article finished. An article with excellent quality. Every one of us was “working consistently at our ideal best.”


### Question 2: When that’s happening, whose needs are we meeting? What new stories could you tell? As a PhD student and as a beneficiary of a scholarship from the CONAHCYT, the main stakeholders of the PhD are the CONAHCYT, the PhD Program, the Thesis Committee, the Thesis Director, the JCR magazines backed up by MDPI, my coworkers, society, and Me as a student.

I will debrief the needs of each stakeholder:
a. Scholarship provider (CONAHCYT -> Science, Technology, and Humanities Council)
	i. Maintain academic or performance quality by the criteria established in the Call for 	Applications or the agreement that originated the scholarship.
	ii. Maintain the academic quality or performance outlined in the Study Program or the approved 	project, always respecting the academic and administrative regulations established by the 	institution, company, or organization where the studies or projects are conducted during the 	scholarship period.
	iii. Comply with the regulations and monitoring procedures established by CONAHCYT.
	iv. Immediately notify CONAHCYT upon obtaining the degree.
	v. Maintain a minimum GPA of 8.0 or equivalent during the academic period and avoid failing 	any subjects.
	vi. Keep personal information updated in the CVU.
	vii. Exercise the right to submit requests to CONACYT public officials in a respectful and 	written manner.

Reglamento de Becas del Consejo Nacional de Humanidades, Ciencias y Tecnologías. https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5694891&fecha=10/07/2023

b. DITA (Technology and Engineering Applied PhD program) requirements:
	i. 4 international conferences with extended abstracts or full articles, one per year.
	ii. 2 JCR articles.
	iii. TOEFL score of 550.
	iv. The thesis must be checked for plagiarism, ensuring no more than 14% similarity, supported 	by a certificate (several available platforms).
	v. Finish a Thesis Project with the following structure:
		- Chapter 1: Introduction. A large portion of the information comes from the research 		proposal.
		- Chapter 2: State of the Art. This is the systematic literature review of your 		research project.
		- Chapter 3: Doctoral Project. This includes your proposal and the work you have 		conducted.
		- Chapter 4: Evaluation and Results. As the name suggests, explain what, how, and why 		you evaluated your work. It is recommended that the metrics and indicators used be 		justified thoroughly. Results should compare what was achieved to one or more 			references from Chapter 2.
		- Chapter 5: Conclusions and Future Work. In the conclusions, highlight the 			contributions of your research and how you fulfilled the defined objectives and tested 		the hypotheses. Future work outlines how the study could be continued and its 			potential applications.
c. JCR Journals
	i. Each journal has its rules.
d. Society Requierements
	i. I need to do some social work or work for the program to obtain a letter to approve this 	requirement.
e. My Requirements
	i. Finis all mentioned requirements before 4 years.
	ii. Each semester liberates something to publish.
	iii. Develop my skills to apply for the Researching National System.

### Question 3: What stops that? What gets in the way? This question allows you to identify the main obstacles to overcome to achieve the “Key Accomplishment,” in my case, the PhD grade.

But for now, I am thinking of the Systematic Literature Review. In that order, I need an article sent to a Journal.

What prevents me from sending that SLR to a Journal Magazine Committee for review?
- The style of my Thesis Director and mine was not compatible.
- I don’t have the format of the journals
- The Research Protocol is not finished.
- SLR is not finished.
- My PhD Thesis Director is unfamiliar with my topic (long story).
- I sometimes help my wife with her restaurant (Christmas dinners, I buy a good part of the restaurant , and I help on weekends)
- I have four kids
	- Right now, they are on their Christmas vacations
	- My four kids participate in swimming competencies all year long (this year there were more 	than 10 events. Almost one per month.
- I write blogposts for JAG.coop
- I am a part-time teacher (Ibaktor, URL).

Note the root cause:
- I am at 100% full-time. I don't have slack.
- The money is not enough for our family expenses.

Note. More companies die for indigestion than for starving. - Scaling Up. Hamish.

The True North finishes with the identification of the existing obstacles that you need to overcome to point out the True North...  Then, you need to transform those obstacles into outcomes to start working. The 15-minute FOTO is the tool that Agendashift provides for this purpose.

15-minute FOTO (From Obstacles To Outcomes) uses clean language. Clean language is free of assumptions, opinions, and questions. Clean questions aim to be understood by inquiring wholeheartedly without judging, giving an opinion, or pushing the respondent to follow a specific idea. Clea questions are used as a psychological therapy tool.

Questions are presented in the 15-minute FOTO.  The first question transforms the obstacle into an outcome. That is incredible and very logical. What would you like to have happen?
