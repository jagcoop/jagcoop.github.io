Rozovsky and her study group at Yale School of Management. Instead of being a support group, it was a source of stress. Everyone was fighting for power. Rozovsky decided to join another group. The new group aimed to analyze real business cases. They immediately clicked. In a competition, they were asked to replace a student-run café. In the end, they decided to create a mini gym with two stationary bikes and three treadmills. They won the competition.

How can two groups be so different—one with a stressful atmosphere, and another warm and fertile for generating ideas?

Traditional productivity studies focus on the individual. However, most work is done in teams. Even more so, in the last 50 years, human interaction has increased by over 50%, occupying 1/3 of work time.

In 2012, Google embarked on the Aristotle Project, studying hundreds of individuals. Rakovsky joined Google as part of the Aristotle Project. There were vastly different patterns in high-performing teams. After a year of analyzing 100 teams, they couldn’t find a clear solution. In the end, they tackled the problem by focusing on psychological safety.

What did they study?

What distinguished good teams was how members treated each other. They found two key characteristics:
- **“Equality in the distribution of speaking turns”**: As long as everyone has the opportunity to speak, it's fine. If one person dominates the conversation, collective intelligence drops.
- **“High social sensitivity”**, meaning members were good at sensing how others felt based on tone of voice, expressions, and other non-verbal cues.

**Tips**: Talk more about emotions and how we feel. Google also keeps statistics on this. Why not spend time with people who care about me?

In these teams, there is greater psychological safety: **“a sense of trust that the team won’t embarrass, reject, or punish anyone.”** Talk to your teammates about difficult or sad things. Speak about insecurities, fears, and aspirations in a more constructive way.

Sakaguchi, a former police officer and electronics salesman, was in charge of successfully coordinating a team of engineers at Google. However, when he switched teams, he didn’t achieve the same results. A satisfaction study revealed that many people were dissatisfied because there was no **TRANSPARENCY** regarding the contribution and role of team members. To break the ice, Sakaguchi revealed he had advanced-stage cancer. Everyone was shocked. How could Sakaguchi still be there in such a condition? It was because of the fulfillment of helping the team.

Today’s winners succeed because they have the clarity to discard yesterday’s conventional wisdom and seek the new and innovative...
