# The Future of Money: Control, Chaos, or Something Else?
February 8th, 2025
by *Agus Rumayor*

Those who know me realize that many of my conversations (outside of tech and programming) revolve around imagining a better future where society manages abundance rather than scarcity.

But let‚Äôs be honest: every path to that future seems bumpy, painful, and deeply disruptive to our current systems.

I want to explore two possible futures: government-controlled money and decentralized money, and touch on a hybrid approach. The truth is, I don‚Äôt like any of these scenarios because we are already experiencing the early consequences of each. It sometimes feels like society is doomed no matter what.

On the bright side?
üí° All paths could lead to money truly becomes obsolete, we might finally have the real conversations about creating a social structure built on sustainability and not just as a trendy word but as a functional system.

## Path 1: Governments Controlling and Centralizing Currencies (CBDCs)

In this scenario, governments take full control of money, potentially through Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), here‚Äôs what this might look like:

* ‚úÖ Debt and interest are eliminated. Money is no longer created through lending, just like US currency alternative: the Greenbacks in the 1860s.
* ‚ùå Freedom disappears. Every transaction is tracked, regulated, and programmable. Your ability to buy/sell could be controlled or revoked.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Political & financial manipulation becomes easier than ever, governments could enforce spending limits, expiration dates on money, or deny access based on behavior.
* üìâ Money stops being an asset people own. Instead, people receive controlled units of purchasing power that can be adjusted at any time.

## Path 2: Decentralized Currencies

In this scenario, decentralized currencies like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies dominate, reducing government control but expanding debt and interest to unprecedented levels. Here‚Äôs what this might look like:

* ‚úÖ Maximum financial freedom. People and businesses operate without intermediaries, governments, or central banks; leading to innovation, entrepreneurship, and global financial inclusion.
* ‚ùå Debt expands to unseen levels. Decentralized systems could lead to a proliferation of financial instruments, loans, and credit, potentially increasing debt levels. Rates might fluctuate driven by fear (real or not), speculation and market manipulation could destabilize economies.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è A fragmented financial world. Competing digital currencies create volatility, market manipulation thrives, and global trade becomes more complex.
* üìâ Money loses stability and trust. In a world of endless debt and interest, the value of money could erode, leading to a loss of trust in financial systems. Hyperinflation and deflation cycles could make traditional money meaningless as a long-term store of value.

## The Bigger Picture: Money Losing Relevance

The future of money is not just an economic question but a philosophical one. It forces us to confront fundamental questions about freedom, trust, and the role of governments in our lives. In both scenarios, money as we know it could become irrelevant:

* Under Centralization: Money becomes a tool of state control, losing its intrinsic value and trust as a medium of exchange.
* Under Decentralization: Money becomes fragmented and volatile, losing its stability and reliability as a store of value.
* Under Hybrid approach: A potential hybrid system could exist where governments maintain monetary oversight while allowing decentralized alternatives, this would increase the financial gap between individuals and countries. But history suggests that control and freedom are often at odds. One always tries to dominate the other so it may widen financial inequality rather than solve it.

In either case, the collapse of money‚Äôs relevance could lead to a fundamental rethinking of how societies organize resources, trade, and value. This could lead to the rise of alternative systems like time-based currencies (like "In time" movie) or reputation-based economies (like "Nosedive" from Black Mirror series) but hopefully to a more human systems like a resource-based economy. A shift toward post-scarcity models, where technology and automation reduce the need for traditional money.
