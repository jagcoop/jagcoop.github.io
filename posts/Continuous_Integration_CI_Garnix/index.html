# Continuous Integration (CI): Garnix
January 25th, 2025
by *Karina Chaires*


## Garnix is a hosted CI service based on Nix that integrates seamlessly with GitHub.

Compared to GitHub Actions, CI jobs on Garnix run faster while providing free Nix caching (no need to manually upload to Cachix). It currently only works with flake-enabled repos. 

## Features:

- **Integration with Nix Flakes:**
Garnix uses the configurations defined in the `flake.nix` file, eliminating the need for CI-specific YAML configurations. This means that the same configuration running on your local machine will be executed in the CI environment.

- **Shared Binary Cache:**
Garnix offers a globally shared binary cache. This means that build results from various projects are stored and shared, making the compilation process faster. Pre-compiled components can be reused, enhancing overall efficiency.

- **Multi-Platform Support:**
Garnix supports multiple platforms on both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures,
including Linux and macOS. Projects targeting different environments can be
seamlessly integrated and tested within the CI pipeline.

- **Efficient Build Processes:**
Unlike some CI services that clear the `/nix/store` folder after each execution, Garnix retains this store, allowing for faster subsequent builds.

## Considerations:

Itâ€™s important to note that Garnix is not currently open-source. However, the service emphasizes minimal vendor lock-in. Configurations rely primarily on standard Nix practices, so transitioning away from Garnix, if needed, would not require extensive reconfiguration.

## Example:

```nix
{
  description = "A simple sample Nix project";
  outputs = { ... }:
    {

     checks = {
        x86_64-linux.test = ...;
      };



      packages = {
        x86_64-linux.frontend = ...;
        aarch64-darwin.devServer = ...;
      };



      nixosConfigurations = {
        server = ...;
        db = ...;
      };
  };
}
```


## Conclusion:

Garnix offers an attractive CI solution that combines simplicity, efficiency, and robust features. Its deep integration with Nix and user-friendly design make it a compelling option for achieving an optimized CI workflow.

According to the official site, integrating Garnix is as simple as "Click. Push. Done." All you need to do is install the Garnix GitHub App and push a `flake.nix` file to your repository. Garnix takes care of everything else: building your software, running tests, and even provisioning and deploying your servers.
