The Founder. The history Ray Croc and McDonalds from the Intellectual Property Point of View
By Pepe Hernandez. February 6th, 2025.

# Introduction  

*"History is written by the victors."*  
— Winston Churchill  

On McDonald's Spanish website, under the "About Us" section, we can read:  
*"Our story begins with a man. In 1954, a man named Ray Kroc discovered a small burger restaurant in California and wrote the first page of our history..."*  

According to McDonald's, the story begins with Ray Kroc, despite the fact that it actually started 14 years earlier with the first restaurant owned by the McDonald brothers.

## Summary of *The Founder*  

*The Founder* is a film based on true events, meaning it is an adaptation with a certain degree of creative interpretation by the authors. The movie narrates the story of Ray Kroc, a milkshake machine salesman struggling to make sales.  

When his company assigns him to deliver six machines to a single restaurant—the McDonald brothers' restaurant—he becomes curious about how a single location could need so many machines. There, he discovers the **Speedy System**, the innovative fast-food production method invented by the McDonald brothers.  

Ray proposes franchising the restaurant and, after multiple attempts and negotiations, convinces the brothers. As the chain expands, he realizes that despite the growing number of locations, the business is not as profitable as he desires. He attempts to cut costs by replacing vanilla ice cream with a powdered substitute, leading to conflicts with the McDonald brothers, as he had agreed not to alter internal operations.  

Kroc then seeks a loan to continue expanding and meets a financial advisor who advises him to focus on **real estate**. Ray establishes a real estate firm, effectively **bypassing** the McDonald brothers. This decision enables McDonald's to expand globally and become what it is today.  

With full control, Kroc negotiates the purchase of the entire franchise, including the **McDonald's brand**, for **$1.4 million per brother**—equivalent to **$10 million today**. The McDonald brothers become millionaires, but their original restaurant is left out of the deal. Meanwhile, the **McDonald's name and the golden arches design** become the property of Kroc’s newly established company.  

### Criticism of the Film  

One common critique of *The Founder* is that it portrays Ray Kroc as a manipulative businessman who **exploited** two small entrepreneurs and **took** their intellectual property.  

According to a Reddit user, Ray Kroc was the one responsible for making McDonald's a global brand, and he identified himself as the founder of the company.

## Intellectual Property Identification and Analysis  

In **1961**, McDonald's key intellectual property assets included:  

1. **Trademarks** – The **McDonald's name**, the **golden arches design**, and the **jingle**.  
2. **Trade Secrets** – The **Speedy System**, the innovative production method created by the McDonald brothers.  
3. **Franchise Agreements** – The structured franchise model agreed upon between Kroc and the McDonald brothers.  

### Lack of Patents  

The McDonald brothers **could have patented** several of their innovations, as they modified and created new equipment to implement their system. However, since the **Speedy System** was **not patented**, there was no legal barrier preventing Kroc from **adopting and imposing** his own vision.  

### Trademarks and Branding  

The **McDonald's name** was recognized for evoking warmth and trust. The **golden arches**, originally conceived by the McDonald brothers in **1952**, later became the company's official logo when Kroc took over in **1961**. By **1968**, the logo had evolved into a design similar to today's version.

## Study of the Franchise Model and Intellectual Property  

According to the **World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)**, franchises typically integrate multiple intellectual property elements, including **trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and business models**.  

McDonald's success was largely due to the **franchise model**, which combined:  

- The **Speedy System** for production.  
- The **design of buildings and logos**.  
- Standardized **operational processes**.  
- **Trademarks** and branding elements.  

The McDonald brothers **underestimated** the **global potential** of their brand. While Kroc’s **legal acquisition** of the brand was valid, its **ethical implications** remain debatable. However, as Steve Jobs once said:  

*"It's very difficult to connect the dots looking forward; it's easy to do it looking backward."*  

McDonald's became a **global brand** thanks to the **initial groundwork** laid by the McDonald brothers, Kroc’s **business acumen**, and his strategic acquisition of the **trademark** and **franchise system**.
