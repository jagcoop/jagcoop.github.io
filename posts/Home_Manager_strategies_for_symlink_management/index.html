# Home Manager strategies for symlink management

November 15th, 2024
by *Julio César*

We&rsquo;ve discussed before how Home Manager can be used for managing user level configuration, more specifically to manage the *&ldquo;dotfiles&rdquo;* on a linux based workstation, we discussed how Home Manager is a nice declarative alternative to plain symbolic links, a.k.a. &ldquo;*symlinks*&rdquo;. However, some times (hopefully just on a few occasions) it is necessary to have symlinks lying around, this was the case for my Emacs Doom configuration which for the moment I do not want to migrate to a Home Manager + Nix based setup since I&rsquo;d have to rebuild and switch my configuration every so often whenever I extend Emacs in any way - something that happens a lot.

My usual approach was to to install my Emacs Doom configuration into place like this:

```sh
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/doom ~/.config/doom
```

However, having to manually create this symlink separately of activating my Home Manager configuration wasn&rsquo;t ideal, the bike shed needed new paint. It turns out it is possible to *declare* symbolic links in the Home Manager configuration, there are three approaches I could use, and these are outlined below.


# Using the `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` library function

This is the current approach I&rsquo;m using right now, and it looks like this:

```nix
{
  # some options ...

  home.file.doom =
    let
      flakeRoot = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/workspace/config/dotfiles";
    in
    {
      enable = true;
      source = config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "${flakeRoot}/doom";
      target = "${config.xdg.configHome}/doom";
    };

  # more options ...
}
```

We instruct Home Manager to allocate a file with the `home.file` option and declare a variable to the location of the dotfiles repo (a flake itself) which contains Emacs Doom configuration in a `doom/` sub-directory, then the target is declared using the `xdg.configHome` option which expands to something like `~/.config` on my system, therefore linking the configuration into place (in `~/.config/doom`).


# Using the `home.activation` option

Home Manager allow us to hook some actions while the Home Manager configuration is being activated, we declare such actions using the `home.activation` option, example:

```nix
{
  # some options ...

  doomActivationAction =
    let
      flakeRoot = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/workspace/config/dotfiles";
    in
      lib.hm.dag.entryAfter [ "writeBoundary" ] ''
        run ln -s $VERBOSE_ARG ${flakeRoot}/doom ${config.xdg.configHome}/doom
      '';

  # more options ...
}
```

This just calls `ln` within a script to create a link in the right location, `run` is a shell function made available by home-manager that handles the output stream correctly when the user asked for a verbose behavior, `$VERBOSE_ARG` just expands to `--verbose`.


# Declare a systemd bind mount unit

This one is a bit far fetched but it is so cool we&rsquo;re able to declare systemd units with Home Manager and that systemd provides &ldquo;bind mounts&rdquo; which can be used as an alternative to symlinks, i.e. make a directory (or a file system) available at some other location in our file system:

```nix
{
  # some options ...

  systemd.user.mount =
    let
      flakeRoot = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/workspace/config/dotfiles";
    in
    {
      emacs-doom-mount = {
        Unit = {
          Description = "Mount Emacs Doom configuration into place";
        };

        Install = {
          WantedBy = [ "default.target" ];
        };

        Mount = {
          What = "${flakeRoot}/doom";
          Where = "${config.xdg.configHome}/doom";
          Type = "none";
          Options = "bind";
        };
      };
    };

  # other options ...
}
```


# Conclusion

The only disadvantage to all these strategies is that we have to hard-code the path of the source, in this case the `flakeRoot` value, as there&rsquo;s no way to say &ldquo;give me the path to this (self) nix file&rdquo; because such questions are considered &ldquo;impure&rdquo;. This is possible to work around by using something like [flake-root](https://github.com/srid/flake-root) which I&rsquo;ve not used yet but it would still feel like a hack.

While we could try using something like `builtins.toPath ../../doom` (assuming our `doom` configuration is two levels up), it wouldn&rsquo;t be what we want even if it works, referring to &ldquo;the current path&rdquo; will resolve to a path within the `/nix/store` which will contain a copy of our Emacs Doom configuration, not the real one!.

> ℹ️ when using flakes the whole git repository is copied verbatim to the Nix store.

In any case, this only bothers me because the symlink I want to setup goes into my own flake configuration which makes things a bit circular, however, the premise of the post is that even symlinks are seen as &ldquo;resources&rdquo; in Home Manager and thus can be managed declaratively in our configuration.
