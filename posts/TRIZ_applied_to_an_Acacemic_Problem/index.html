# TRIZ Applied to an Academic Problem
By Pepe Hernandez, 2024

## Introduction  

This work addresses the challenge posed by the professor regarding the integration of elements or topics related to the **Technology and Innovation Management** class into our doctoral thesis project. Among the alternatives provided, we had to answer the question:  

### How can Technology Management be used to propose an improvement to our projects?  

- Incorporate technology management elements to enhance our projects  
- Propose a new research line  
- Use tools such as AI  
- Employ various experimental methods  

I chose **option c: "use a tool."** The selected tool is **TRIZ**. The approach to using TRIZ is to **systematically address** the fundamental research questions outlined in my research proposal.  

But what is **TRIZ**, and how can it be useful in the context of this class?  

> *"To solve problems that require thinking outside the box, we have historically relied on talented thinkers. This is not a replicable systematic process and is solely based on individual thinking—an approach limited by personal knowledge, experience, inspiration, and luck."*  
> — *Gordon Cameron, 2010*  

### What is TRIZ?  

**TRIZ** is a **Russian acronym** that stands for **"Theory of Inventive Problem Solving."** It was developed by **G. Altshuller** between **1946 and 1985** in the USSR. By the **1980s**, TRIZ had expanded globally, and in the **late 1990s**, it was incorporated into **Six Sigma** and other quality disciplines.  

Altshuller stated:  
> *"You can wait 100 years for enlightenment, or you can solve the problem in 15 minutes by applying these principles."*  

Through the study of over **200,000 patents**, Altshuller discovered, among other things:  

- The **solutions** to problems and their resolutions **recur** across multiple industries, services, and products.  
- The **classification of a problem** predicts its solution.  
- Innovations use **scientific effects** outside the field where they were originally developed, which anticipates **cross-functional usefulness** through **benchmarking**.  

### Tools for This Exercise  

In this exercise, I will use **three powerful tools** to analyze and refine my doctoral research proposal:  

1. The **General TRIZ Framework**  
2. The **Nine Windows** technique  
3. The **Problem Zones** or **5W + 2H** method

### General TRIZ Framework  

**Edward de Bono**, in his book *Six Thinking Hats*, presents a technique that serves as a **starting point for creativity**. It involves compiling a **list of creative problems** by generating **"How can I...?"** questions.  

This approach helps our minds gather ideas quickly. To contextualize the exercise, a **focus area** is established. Examples of focus areas include:  

- Recent problems  
- Your workplace  
- Everyday life  
- Continuous improvement  

Using the **focus of this study** as an example, we formulate our **TRIZ** question:  

#### **Key Research Question**  

> *"How can I increase the productivity of independent software developers so they can compete with super-developers using AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Amazon Whisperer, or GitHub Copilot?"*  

---

### Contradiction in TRIZ  

To begin with TRIZ, we must **start with a contradiction**. A problem can be framed as a **contradiction**. Examples:  

- *How can I sleep and not sleep at the same time?*  
- *I want my coffee hot, but I also want it cold.*  

A **contradiction** is often associated with a **tradeoff** in English.  

For our exercise, to define the contradiction, we need to identify the **key elements** in the original question:  

#### **Key Elements of the Problem**  

- **Increase productivity:** The main goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of developers.  
- **Independent software developers:** These are the subjects of the problem who need to compete in a highly technological environment.  
- **Use of advanced AI tools:** The "super-developers" leverage tools like **ChatGPT, Copilot, or Whisperer**, setting a high standard of competition.  

#### **Refined Contradiction**  

> *"How can I increase the productivity of independent software developers so they can effectively compete in an environment dominated by super-developers using advanced AI tools—without incurring prohibitive costs or requiring an unattainable level of technical skills?"*
