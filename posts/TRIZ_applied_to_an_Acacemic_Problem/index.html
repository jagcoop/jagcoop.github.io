# TRIZ Applied to an Academic Problem
By Pepe Hernandez, 2024

## Introduction  

This work addresses the challenge posed by the professor regarding the integration of elements or topics related to the **Technology and Innovation Management** class into our doctoral thesis project. Among the alternatives provided, we had to answer the question:  

### How can Technology Management be used to propose an improvement to our projects?  

- Incorporate technology management elements to enhance our projects  
- Propose a new research line  
- Use tools such as AI  
- Employ various experimental methods  

I chose **option c: "use a tool."** The selected tool is **TRIZ**. The approach to using TRIZ is to **systematically address** the fundamental research questions outlined in my research proposal.  

But what is **TRIZ**, and how can it be useful in the context of this class?  

> *"To solve problems that require thinking outside the box, we have historically relied on talented thinkers. This is not a replicable systematic process and is solely based on individual thinking—an approach limited by personal knowledge, experience, inspiration, and luck."*  
> — *Gordon Cameron, 2010*  

### What is TRIZ?  

**TRIZ** is a **Russian acronym** that stands for **"Theory of Inventive Problem Solving."** It was developed by **G. Altshuller** between **1946 and 1985** in the USSR. By the **1980s**, TRIZ had expanded globally, and in the **late 1990s**, it was incorporated into **Six Sigma** and other quality disciplines.  

Altshuller stated:  
> *"You can wait 100 years for enlightenment, or you can solve the problem in 15 minutes by applying these principles."*  

Through the study of over **200,000 patents**, Altshuller discovered, among other things:  

- The **solutions** to problems and their resolutions **recur** across multiple industries, services, and products.  
- The **classification of a problem** predicts its solution.  
- Innovations use **scientific effects** outside the field where they were originally developed, which anticipates **cross-functional usefulness** through **benchmarking**.  

### Tools for This Exercise  

In this exercise, I will use **three powerful tools** to analyze and refine my doctoral research proposal:  

1. The **General TRIZ Framework**  
2. The **Nine Windows** technique  
3. The **Problem Zones** or **5W + 2H** method

### General TRIZ Framework  

**Edward de Bono**, in his book *Six Thinking Hats*, presents a technique that serves as a **starting point for creativity**. It involves compiling a **list of creative problems** by generating **"How can I...?"** questions.  

This approach helps our minds gather ideas quickly. To contextualize the exercise, a **focus area** is established. Examples of focus areas include:  

- Recent problems  
- Your workplace  
- Everyday life  
- Continuous improvement  

Using the **focus of this study** as an example, we formulate our **TRIZ** question:  

#### **Key Research Question**  

> *"How can I increase the productivity of independent software developers so they can compete with super-developers using AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Amazon Whisperer, or GitHub Copilot?"*  

---

### Contradiction in TRIZ  

To begin with TRIZ, we must **start with a contradiction**. A problem can be framed as a **contradiction**. Examples:  

- *How can I sleep and not sleep at the same time?*  
- *I want my coffee hot, but I also want it cold.*  

A **contradiction** is often associated with a **tradeoff** in English.  

For our exercise, to define the contradiction, we need to identify the **key elements** in the original question:  

#### **Key Elements of the Problem**  

- **Increase productivity:** The main goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of developers.  
- **Independent software developers:** These are the subjects of the problem who need to compete in a highly technological environment.  
- **Use of advanced AI tools:** The "super-developers" leverage tools like **ChatGPT, Copilot, or Whisperer**, setting a high standard of competition.  

#### **Refined Contradiction**  

> *"How can I increase the productivity of independent software developers so they can effectively compete in an environment dominated by super-developers using advanced AI tools—without incurring prohibitive costs or requiring an unattainable level of technical skills?"*

## TRIZ and Its Applications  

TRIZ is used in multiple companies around the world for **solving invention-related problems**. The previous diagram was obtained from a review of a **masterclass by Philips**, where the methodology is promoted  (*Masterclass: How to Solve Your Technical Problems Using TRIZ | Philips Engineering Solutions, 2019*).  

TRIZ is based on the assumption that:  

> **"Someone, somewhere, has already solved your problem—just in a different field."**  

Creativity consists of **finding that solution and adapting it** to the specific circumstances of the problem.  

### TRIZ Problem-Solving Process  

1. **Problem Analysis** – Identify and understand the problem.  
2. **Generalization of the Problem** – Abstract the issue into a broader context.  
3. **Search for Solutions in Other Fields** – Investigate how similar problems have been solved elsewhere.  
4. **Adapt the General Solution** – Apply the identified solution to the specific problem.  
5. **Evaluate the Alternatives** – Assess the effectiveness of the adapted solution.  

If **undesired effects** arise, the analysis must be **refined or redefined**.  

If a **new problem emerges** from the evaluated alternative, a **new TRIZ iteration** is necessary.  

---

### **The Concept of Idealization in TRIZ**  

A guiding principle in TRIZ is **idealization**. The **equation that defines idealization** in TRIZ is:  

\[
\text{Idealization} = \frac{\sum \text{Benefits}}{\sum \text{Costs} + \sum \text{Harms}}
\]  

This equation helps to **easily determine** whether a solution improves a problem compared to the baseline.

## **Exercise 2: General TRIZ Framework**  

### **Analysis and Solutions for Increasing Software Engineers' Productivity**

##### **Specific Problem**  
➡ **Increase the productivity of independent software engineers** so they can **compete against more specialized engineers** equipped with **support tools such as artificial intelligence tools.**  

#### **General Problem**  
➡ **How to increase the productivity of knowledge workers** to **compete against better-equipped and more skilled workers?**  

#### **General Solution**  
Peter Drucker proposes **four key points** to improve the efficiency of knowledge workers:  
- **Focus on the task at hand.**  
- **Consider the knowledge worker as an investment**, as they are a means of production.  
- **Knowledge workers are responsible for their own contribution.**  
- **Quality is as important as quantity.**  

#### **Specific Solution**  
To **increase the productivity of independent software engineers**, applying **Drucker’s general solution:**  

##### **1. Focus on the task at hand → Focus on outcomes**  
Josh Seiden defines **outcomes** as a **change in the behavior of people or elements in the system we are working on.**  

##### **2. The worker is an investment → Treat independent professionals as service providers**  
David Anderson states that, **as independent professionals, we offer services to others, and these services must be managed accordingly.**  

##### **3. Workers are responsible for their own contribution**  
Each independent worker should:  
- Define **what they offer and the quality criteria** for their service.  
- **Continuously improve** their services and skills.  

##### **4. Quality is as important as quantity → What is the optimal service quality?**  
A **2004 study by Ramírez and Nembhard** analyzed **23 productivity models** and created a **taxonomy of 13 dimensions** grouping the metrics used in each model. Their findings include:  
- **71% of the models** define productivity in terms of **quantity.**  
- **Only 21%** explicitly consider **quality.**  
- Each model examined **only uses 2 or 3 productivity dimensions.**  

This raises a **key research question** for our study:  
➡ **What are the relevant productivity metrics for independent software developers?**  

#### **Summary: Key Insights from TRIZ for Our Doctoral Thesis**  
The **TRIZ methodology** helped us identify **two key areas** to advance in our doctoral research:  
1. **Focus on tasks and outcomes.**  
2. **Define the interfaces of independent developers as a microservice.**  
3. **Establish quality metrics related to the service.**  
4. **Identify productivity metrics relevant to independent software developers.**

The **"Nine Windows"** tool in **TRIZ** is a technique used to **expand the perspective of a problem** and explore **more comprehensive solutions.** It consists of a **3x3 diagram,** where:  
- The **columns** represent **different moments in time** (**past, present, and future**).  
- The **rows** represent **different system levels** (**system, subsystem, and supersystem**).  

By analyzing a problem through these **"nine windows,"** we consider a **broader context,** its **possible evolution,** and **interactions between system components.**  
This methodology helps us **identify non-obvious solutions** that might be missed if we only focus on the **immediate problem and its current scale.**

                  **Source: "9 Windows - Sketchplanations"**  

On the **Sketchplanations** website, an example of a **system** (in this case, a **table**) placed at the center of the diagram demonstrates how:  
- **Looking back in time:** The table originates from a **tree.**  
- **Looking forward in time:** The table might become a **second-hand piece of furniture** in the future.  

Each level (**system, subsystem, and supersystem**) can be analyzed:  
- **Present:**  
  - At the **system level**, the table is a product sold by companies like **IKEA.**  
  - At the **subsystem level**, it consists of components such as **wood.**  
- **Future:**  
  - The **recycled table** might turn into **compost.**  
  - At the **supersystem level**, this waste could become part of a **reforestation program.**  
- **Past:**  
  - At the **system level**, the table was once a **tree.**  
  - At the **supersystem level**, it belonged to a **forest.**  
  - At the **subsystem level**, it started as a **sapling** that eventually grew into a mature tree producing wood.

**Table 2. The nine windows applied to the thesis protocol problem.**

The previous table is an exercise using the nine windows framework, answering each question within the current thesis context. It is worth noting that each exercise can vary, but it provides a better perspective on the problem to be analyzed.  

From the perspective offered by the nine windows, each question helps us view the problem from different angles. One useful conclusion is to examine market trends in independent service developers:  

### Market Trends for Independent Professionals in 2023  
According to Jon Younger from *Forbes*, the trends for independent professionals are:  

- A greater focus on hiring independent teams when internal talent is unavailable. The German service Vicoland.com, the French Weem.work, the British Itarmi.com, the German HelloMaaS.com, the Spanish Outvise.com, and the American Upstackhq.com offer work for independent teams.  
- Some independent worker service companies are expanding their borders.  
- Some companies are creating their own portals for independent workers.  
- Complementary jobs for individuals who already have a formal job.  

Simply reflecting on different perspectives allows us to better understand our problem. As Albert Einstein once said, *"The formulation of a problem is often more important than its solution."*
