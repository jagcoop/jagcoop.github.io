# TRIZ Applied to an Academic Problem
By Pepe Hernandez, 2024

## Introduction  

This work addresses the challenge posed by the professor regarding the integration of elements or topics related to the **Technology and Innovation Management** class into our doctoral thesis project. Among the alternatives provided, we had to answer the question:  

### How can Technology Management be used to propose an improvement to our projects?  

- Incorporate technology management elements to enhance our projects  
- Propose a new research line  
- Use tools such as AI  
- Employ various experimental methods  

I chose **option c: "use a tool."** The selected tool is **TRIZ**. The approach to using TRIZ is to **systematically address** the fundamental research questions outlined in my research proposal.  

But what is **TRIZ**, and how can it be useful in the context of this class?  

> *"To solve problems that require thinking outside the box, we have historically relied on talented thinkers. This is not a replicable systematic process and is solely based on individual thinking—an approach limited by personal knowledge, experience, inspiration, and luck."*  
> — *Gordon Cameron, 2010*  

### What is TRIZ?  

**TRIZ** is a **Russian acronym** that stands for **"Theory of Inventive Problem Solving."** It was developed by **G. Altshuller** between **1946 and 1985** in the USSR. By the **1980s**, TRIZ had expanded globally, and in the **late 1990s**, it was incorporated into **Six Sigma** and other quality disciplines.  

Altshuller stated:  
> *"You can wait 100 years for enlightenment, or you can solve the problem in 15 minutes by applying these principles."*  

Through the study of over **200,000 patents**, Altshuller discovered, among other things:  

- The **solutions** to problems and their resolutions **recur** across multiple industries, services, and products.  
- The **classification of a problem** predicts its solution.  
- Innovations use **scientific effects** outside the field where they were originally developed, which anticipates **cross-functional usefulness** through **benchmarking**.  

### Tools for This Exercise  

In this exercise, I will use **three powerful tools** to analyze and refine my doctoral research proposal:  

1. The **General TRIZ Framework**  
2. The **Nine Windows** technique  
3. The **Problem Zones** or **5W + 2H** method

### General TRIZ Framework  

**Edward de Bono**, in his book *Six Thinking Hats*, presents a technique that serves as a **starting point for creativity**. It involves compiling a **list of creative problems** by generating **"How can I...?"** questions.  

This approach helps our minds gather ideas quickly. To contextualize the exercise, a **focus area** is established. Examples of focus areas include:  

- Recent problems  
- Your workplace  
- Everyday life  
- Continuous improvement  

Using the **focus of this study** as an example, we formulate our **TRIZ** question:  

#### **Key Research Question**  

> *"How can I increase the productivity of independent software developers so they can compete with super-developers using AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Amazon Whisperer, or GitHub Copilot?"*  

---

### Contradiction in TRIZ  

To begin with TRIZ, we must **start with a contradiction**. A problem can be framed as a **contradiction**. Examples:  

- *How can I sleep and not sleep at the same time?*  
- *I want my coffee hot, but I also want it cold.*  

A **contradiction** is often associated with a **tradeoff** in English.  

For our exercise, to define the contradiction, we need to identify the **key elements** in the original question:  

#### **Key Elements of the Problem**  

- **Increase productivity:** The main goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of developers.  
- **Independent software developers:** These are the subjects of the problem who need to compete in a highly technological environment.  
- **Use of advanced AI tools:** The "super-developers" leverage tools like **ChatGPT, Copilot, or Whisperer**, setting a high standard of competition.  

#### **Refined Contradiction**  

> *"How can I increase the productivity of independent software developers so they can effectively compete in an environment dominated by super-developers using advanced AI tools—without incurring prohibitive costs or requiring an unattainable level of technical skills?"*

## TRIZ and Its Applications  

TRIZ is used in multiple companies around the world for **solving invention-related problems**. The previous diagram was obtained from a review of a **masterclass by Philips**, where the methodology is promoted  (*Masterclass: How to Solve Your Technical Problems Using TRIZ | Philips Engineering Solutions, 2019*).  

TRIZ is based on the assumption that:  

> **"Someone, somewhere, has already solved your problem—just in a different field."**  

Creativity consists of **finding that solution and adapting it** to the specific circumstances of the problem.  

### TRIZ Problem-Solving Process  

1. **Problem Analysis** – Identify and understand the problem.  
2. **Generalization of the Problem** – Abstract the issue into a broader context.  
3. **Search for Solutions in Other Fields** – Investigate how similar problems have been solved elsewhere.  
4. **Adapt the General Solution** – Apply the identified solution to the specific problem.  
5. **Evaluate the Alternatives** – Assess the effectiveness of the adapted solution.  

If **undesired effects** arise, the analysis must be **refined or redefined**.  

If a **new problem emerges** from the evaluated alternative, a **new TRIZ iteration** is necessary.

### **The Concept of Idealization in TRIZ**  

A guiding principle in TRIZ is **idealization**. The **equation that defines idealization** in TRIZ is:  

\[
\text{Idealization} = \frac{\sum \text{Benefits}}{\sum \text{Costs} + \sum \text{Harms}}
\]  

This equation helps to **easily determine** whether a solution improves a problem compared to the baseline.

## **Exercise 2: General TRIZ Framework**  

### **Analysis and Solutions for Increasing Software Engineers' Productivity**

##### **Specific Problem**  
➡ **Increase the productivity of independent software engineers** so they can **compete against more specialized engineers** equipped with **support tools such as artificial intelligence tools.**  

#### **General Problem**  
➡ **How to increase the productivity of knowledge workers** to **compete against better-equipped and more skilled workers?**  

#### **General Solution**  
Peter Drucker proposes **four key points** to improve the efficiency of knowledge workers:  
- **Focus on the task at hand.**  
- **Consider the knowledge worker as an investment**, as they are a means of production.  
- **Knowledge workers are responsible for their own contribution.**  
- **Quality is as important as quantity.**  

#### **Specific Solution**  
To **increase the productivity of independent software engineers**, applying **Drucker’s general solution:**  

##### **1. Focus on the task at hand → Focus on outcomes**  
Josh Seiden defines **outcomes** as a **change in the behavior of people or elements in the system we are working on.**  

##### **2. The worker is an investment → Treat independent professionals as service providers**  
David Anderson states that, **as independent professionals, we offer services to others, and these services must be managed accordingly.**  

##### **3. Workers are responsible for their own contribution**  
Each independent worker should:  
- Define **what they offer and the quality criteria** for their service.  
- **Continuously improve** their services and skills.  

##### **4. Quality is as important as quantity → What is the optimal service quality?**  
A **2004 study by Ramírez and Nembhard** analyzed **23 productivity models** and created a **taxonomy of 13 dimensions** grouping the metrics used in each model. Their findings include:  
- **71% of the models** define productivity in terms of **quantity.**  
- **Only 21%** explicitly consider **quality.**  
- Each model examined **only uses 2 or 3 productivity dimensions.**  

This raises a **key research question** for our study:  
➡ **What are the relevant productivity metrics for independent software developers?**  

#### **Summary: Key Insights from TRIZ for Our Doctoral Thesis**  
The **TRIZ methodology** helped us identify **two key areas** to advance in our doctoral research:  
1. **Focus on tasks and outcomes.**  
2. **Define the interfaces of independent developers as a microservice.**  
3. **Establish quality metrics related to the service.**  
4. **Identify productivity metrics relevant to independent software developers.**

The **"Nine Windows"** tool in **TRIZ** is a technique used to **expand the perspective of a problem** and explore **more comprehensive solutions.** It consists of a **3x3 diagram,** where:  
- The **columns** represent **different moments in time** (**past, present, and future**).  
- The **rows** represent **different system levels** (**system, subsystem, and supersystem**).  

By analyzing a problem through these **"nine windows,"** we consider a **broader context,** its **possible evolution,** and **interactions between system components.**  
This methodology helps us **identify non-obvious solutions** that might be missed if we only focus on the **immediate problem and its current scale.**

                  **Source: "9 Windows - Sketchplanations"**  

On the **Sketchplanations** website, an example of a **system** (in this case, a **table**) placed at the center of the diagram demonstrates how:  
- **Looking back in time:** The table originates from a **tree.**  
- **Looking forward in time:** The table might become a **second-hand piece of furniture** in the future.  

Each level (**system, subsystem, and supersystem**) can be analyzed:  
- **Present:**  
  - At the **system level**, the table is a product sold by companies like **IKEA.**  
  - At the **subsystem level**, it consists of components such as **wood.**  
- **Future:**  
  - The **recycled table** might turn into **compost.**  
  - At the **supersystem level**, this waste could become part of a **reforestation program.**  
- **Past:**  
  - At the **system level**, the table was once a **tree.**  
  - At the **supersystem level**, it belonged to a **forest.**  
  - At the **subsystem level**, it started as a **sapling** that eventually grew into a mature tree producing wood.
