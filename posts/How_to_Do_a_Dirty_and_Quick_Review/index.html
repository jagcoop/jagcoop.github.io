# Quick and Dirty Review, as an alternative to be aware and exposed to ideas of specific field.
By Pepe Hernandez. December 23th, 2024

I am working in my PhD. A pair of moths ago I was looking for information in the field of "Software Product Management", and "Artificial Intelligence". Alex suggested to me use QnDReviews. We had a very interesting conversation.
Right now, I did an exercise with a paper.
The conclusions of the teacher make sense: this is an exercise to be aware of the field very fast, and also, to be exposed to new ideas.
It is a useful exercise for someone looking for a topic to research, or need to knows fastly the state of the art.
If you do this, you will have a good context.

## What is an QnDReview
Ji Soo Yi is a academic research teacher.
He has an assignment for his students called the dirty research.
Students need to read 100 papers each in four minutes.
Students write their observations and follow with the next article in and xls document.
The observations need to be more precise than "this was a good paper".

## What is the goal of the QnDReview
The goal of this exercise is to be aware of how their field is changing, and be exposed to a new ideas.
 
This is the link where the technique is explained "QnDReview: read 100 CHI papers in 7 hours" 
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2559206.2578884

In the same link there is a slideshow:
If you could read 3326 papers you would need between 1 or 2 hours per paper. If you read 8 hours per day, you will need between 416 to 832 hours. That is impossible.

## Conclusions about using it with his students in five years 
Half of students thing this exercise is boring. 
A quarter of students things is boring but useful.
And, the last quarter enjoy the exercise.

Here you have the thirty seconds intro to the technique.

Alex found this because someone studying psychology tried the technique... You can see the exercise here https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/qnd-review-of-ppig-1989-2015.

The psychology students spent several months trying to use the technique. Lastly, he could read 50 articles per day. But he thinks that instead of using a lot of time looking and filtering articles, he would select papers randomly and would finish in just a day. 

## Propose exercises
1. Reading 16 articles in two hours.
1. Read an article in 10 minutes.

### This is the proceddure
This is the receipt for the "Quick and Dirty Review QnDReview".

1. Set the chronometer to 5 minutes.
2. Review the abstract
3. Review the research question
4. Review the method
5. See all graphics
6. Go to the conclusions

Write your observations.
Go to the following article, and start the process again...

### The result for the sencond exercise: just one article in 10 minutes.

A quick exercise to determine what is the right journal to apply for a Systematic Literature Review on Software Product Management. 

I am looking in the MDPI webpage articles related to Artificial Intelligence, and Software Product Management.

I look for the terms "Software Product Management", and "Artificial Intelligence".
MDPI search located 25 articles.

From that articles, I choose those articles I choose

#### What is the inclusion criteria:
- Articles that relates to both search terms.
- Articles that include Software Engineering (a wider scope for Software Product Management) instead of SPM.

#### What is the exclusion criteria:
- All articles related to Project Management are discarded.
- The Potential of AI-Driven Assistants in Scaled Agile Software Development. Link: https://www.mdpi.com/2620418

#### Resume of the Article  
- Type of Article: Synthetic Knowledge Synthesis
- Techniques: Bibliometric mapping, and content analysis

#### Research Questions:
- What is the volume of the research on using AI in Software Engineering?
- What is the maturity status of the research?
- What are the volume and dynamics of the production of the research literature on AI use in software?
- How is the research geographically distributed
- Which information sources informing the scientific community are the most prolific?
- Which funding bodies sponsoring research on AI in software engineering are the most prolific?
- What are the most prolific research themes?

#### Figures, and description
- Figure 1. The dynamics of the research literature productivity.
- Figure 2. The research landscape of AI use in software engineering, keywords appearing in 20 or more publications are shown. Colors represent clusters.

#### Insights:
- It does not talk about Software Product Management, it includes Project Management.
- Is software development management, software product management? What are the differences.

#### Conclusions:
- There is just a search string. Researches run the search string in Scopus.
- There is a section for each theme.
- There is a table with the

#### Future work:
- Include non-peer-reviewed media such as preprints, and do it periodically.

Not so bad. I will work in the two hours exercise, and will link the experience in a new blogpost. Thanks Alex for your recommendations.
