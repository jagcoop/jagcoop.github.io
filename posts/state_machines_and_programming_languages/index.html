     **State Machines and Programming Languages**

I didn't fully comprehend the power of state machines, until I saw the Elm Architecture.

On this article, We will explore different representations of state machines in different programming languages.
To see which notations make it clear, What the state machine is doing.
And which notations actually hide the state machine in different parts of the code.

# What are state machines?

State machines are a graphical representation and a mathematical abstraction, of the change of a system overtime.

For example, let's think of a lamp. A lamp can be Off or On

![A lamp can be off or on](./a_lamp.jpeg)

And we can represent it a state machine like:

<script type="text/x-smcat" data-direction="top-down">
initial,
off, on;
initial => off : plug it to wall;
off => on : press button;
on => off : press button;
</script>

Observe that initially the Lamp is not plugged to the wall.
Once we plug it, it starts as being off.
It is until we press the button that it is turned on.
if we press the button again then it turns off.

However, if we have a lamp that has 3 different levels of light: Dim, Medium, Bright.
Then we can represent it as Hierarchical state machine:

<script type="text/x-smcat" data-direction="top-down">
initial,
off,
on {
    Dim => Medium : press button;
    Medium => Bright: press button;
};
initial => off : plug it to wall;
off => on : press button;
on => off: press button;
</script>

# Advantages of Making State Machines Visible

Making state machines explicit has several benefits:
- Clarity and Visibility:
  By showing state transitions clearly (as in the Elm architecture or the P9 protocol), the flow of the program becomes easier to understand.
- Simplified Reasoning:
  Centralizing state logic helps avoid the pitfalls of hidden or scattered state transitions.
- Less Defects:
  Given the two previous points, there cannot be a state that we haven't coded.

# Motivating examples


## The Elm architecture

Elm is a programming language that looks like Haskell, but is used as a replacement to JavaScript in building web user interfaces.

But what makes Elm such a powerful language is something called the 'Elm Architecture' which is a design pattern,
that organizes the code of all Elm web pages.

Well the Elm architecture is just a state machine.

for example our Lamp state machine, would look in elm like this

```elm
module Lamp-Machine exposing (LampState(..), BrightnessLevel(..), Msg(..), update, init)

-- Define the possible brightness levels
type BrightnessLevel
    = Dim
    | Medium
    | Bright


-- Define the possible states of our lamp
type LampState
    = Initial
    | Off
    | On BrightnessLevel


-- Define the possible messages/events
type Msg
    = PlugIn
    | Press


-- Initialize the lamp state
init : LampState
init =
    Initial
```

And Elm's update function would make the transitions clear like this:


```Elm
-- Update function to handle state transitions
update : Msg -> LampState -> LampState
update msg state =
    case ( state, msg ) of
        -- From initial state
        ( Initial, PlugIn ) ->
            Off

        ( Initial, _ ) ->
            state

        -- From off state
        ( Off, Press ) ->
            On Dim

        ( Off, _ ) ->
            state

        -- From on state with different brightness levels
        ( On Dim, Press ) ->
            On Medium

        ( On Medium, Press ) ->
            On Bright

        ( On Bright, Press ) ->
            Off
```

The important thing is that with just those pieces of logic we can generate a website that reflects a lamp.
and that is defect free. Because every possible combination of changes is known before hand.

## The P9 Protocol

The P9 protocol is a protocol that is fundamental to the Planet9 Operating system.
The Planet 9 OS was the next evolution of Unix.
Done by the creators of Unix, C++ , etc.
One of it's characteristics is that everything and we mean everything looks like a file.
- A network connection? that is a file.
- A web browser, that is a also a file
- USB-port also a file.

And the key to make that inter-operativity work is the P9 protocol.
In this article they specify the P9 protocol as state machine.

# Programming Languages and Tools that Use State Machines

## State
Is very well developed library to represent state machines.
The lamp state machine is written like this in XState:

```JavaScript
export const lampMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'lamp',
  initial: 'initial',
  states: {
    initial: {
      on: {
        PLUGIN: 'off'
      }
    },
    off: {
      on: {
        PRESS: 'on'
      }
    },
    on: {
      initial: 'dim',
      states: {
        dim: {
          on: {
            PRESS: 'medium'
          }
        },
        medium: {
          on: {
            PRESS: 'bright'
          }
        },
        bright: {
          on: {
            PRESS: {
              target: '#lamp.off'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Perhaps it is also useful to see this Json document also as a graph:

[![](https://img.plantuml.biz/plantuml/svg/SoWkIImgoIhEp-Egvb9GKCfCKR9IK5BFISmjKDTHqW4BvMMMP2RcWCMXR9WKK7D9QZ5G1gGNHIb402YKduV40_83V4BTFVt0XkMdfQahGMLgmNIj3iGSe0nUCu9SWuCXHkJXCW5P2ueNKZ9peSu7Iw5v0Im6L88YWEa4D6VafgPabkR2dO9m3fAJm5eW2aapFAaeCpsZX0Z38Gf9CHnL62W1J0pfgILWQvL1QK0FEOxGxKPn1seiS85mBPT3QbuAA6q10000)](https://editor.plantuml.com/uml/SoWkIImgoIhEp-Egvb9GKCfCKR9IK5BFISmjKDTHqW4BvMMMP2RcWCMXR9WKK7D9QZ5G1gGNHIb402YKduV40_83V4BTFVt0XkMdfQahGMLgmNIj3iGSe0nUCu9SWuCXHkJXCW5P2ueNKZ9peSu7Iw5v0Im6L88YWEa4D6VafgPabkR2dO9m3fAJm5eW2aapFAaeCpsZX0Z38Gf9CHnL62W1J0pfgILWQvL1QK0FEOxGxKPn1seiS85mBPT3QbuAA6q10000)

### Pros

+ the code just reflects the state machine
+ Observe that, it clearly defines the sub-sates Dim, Medium and Bright inside the On state.
+ It is json, so you can programatically generate the code for the state machine.

### Cons

It has very few cons:

- It only works with JavaScript, although we could probably create interpreters of the state machine in other languages.
- Looking at all the states
- It doesn't have encapsulation meaning the sub-states of ON are declared in the same state machine...  but in order to manage complexity we wouldn't want to see them.

### How to link it with code?

Now how do we use the state machine in the code?

```JavaScript
// Create a service with logging
const lampService = interpret(lampMachine)
  .onTransition((state) => {
    console.log('Current state:', state.value);
  })
  .start(); // Start the service

// Example usage
lampService.send('PLUGIN');   // Logs: Current state: off
lampService.send('PRESS');    // Logs: Current state: on.dim
lampService.send('PRESS');    // Logs: Current state: on.medium
lampService.send('PRESS');    // Logs: Current state: on.bright
lampService.send('PRESS');    // Logs: Current state: off
```

observe that `.onTransition` we create a function that receives as parameter the state `(state) => {...}`
and that function gets called on every state change. So the function is "subscribed" to the state change.

## Ragel

A tool that compiles state machine definitions into code in various programming languages.

For example, our previous state machine could be represented in Ragel:

```c
%%{
    machine lamp;

    # Main states
    initial = 'initial';
    off = 'off';
    on_dim = 'on.dim';
    on_medium = 'on.medium';
    on_bright = 'on.bright';

    # Transitions
    initial -> off 'PLUGIN';
    off -> on_dim 'PRESS';
    on_dim -> on_medium 'PRESS';
    on_medium -> on_bright 'PRESS';
    on_bright -> off 'PRESS';

    # Define the initial state
    start: initial;
}%%
```

* I didn't test this code, it is what Claude 3.7 thinks it would look. But for our purposes gives an idea of the Ragel representation

### Pros

  + The state machine is very few lines of code

### Cons

  - Ragel doesn't support hierarchical state machines by default, so we need to flatten it like with  on.dim, on.medium, etc.
  - After compilation, the state machine essentially becomes documentation within another language.
  - It can suffer from the state explosion problem.

## Plaid

Plaid introduces type state oriented programming, integrating state machines into object-oriented design.

Typestate-Oriented Programming, a paradigm that extends object-oriented programming with type-states. A type-state is like a class, in that it has its own interface (a set of method signatures), representation (fields), and behavior (method implementations). However, the type-state of an object can change over time, and Plaid's type system helps track these changes.

for example our current lamp state machine, would look like this in plaid:

```JavaScript
state Lamp {
    // State hierarchy
    state Initial {
        method plugIn() [ Initial >> Off ] { /* transition logic */ }
    }

    state Off {
        method press() [ Off >> On.Dim ] { /* transition logic */ }
    }

    state On {
        // Nested states
        state Dim {
            method press() [ On.Dim >> On.Medium ] { /* transition logic */ }
        }

        state Medium {
            method press() [ On.Medium >> On.Bright ] { /* transition logic */ }
        }

        state Bright {
            method press() [ On.Bright >> Off ] { /* transition logic */ }
        }
    }

    // Constructor starts in Initial state
    Lamp() [ => Initial ] { /* initialization */ }
}
```
[Implementation of the Lamp State Machine in Plaid, (according to Claude 3.7) ]

Observe that if we are in the state `Off` then the `method press()` transitions the state from: `Off` to `On.Dim`


- Pros:
  - The state machine is part of the object-oriented structure.
  - It represents nested state charts as objects.
- Cons:
  - The state machine can become diluted because the logic is mixed with state transition code.


## Eiffel
Eiffel implements state machines in two distinct ways:

### 1. State Machine Pattern / Component
As proposed by Karine Arnout in her thesis, this approach treats the state machine as a separate component.

#### Pros
  - It is the most documented method for implementing state machines in objects.

#### Cons
  - It creates new objects at run time.
  - The state machine logic is spread across multiple regions of the code.

### 2. As Part of the Features of a Class
This method integrates the state machine within the class itself.

#### Method

  - Uses Boolean flags to indicate the current state.
  - Employs preconditions to ensure that transitions between states are valid.

For example look at this Eiffel code:

```Eiffel
class
    LAMP

    is_off: BOOLEAN
    is_on: BOOLEAN
    is_dim: BOOLEAN
    is_medium: BOOLEAN

    make
            -- Create lamp in initial state.
        do
            is_initial := True
            is_off := False
            is_on := False
            is_dim := False
            is_medium := False
            is_bright := False
        ensure
            in_initial_state: is_initial
        end

feature -- Transitions

            -- Plug the lamp to the wall.
        require
            is_in_initial_state: is_initial
        do
            is_initial := False
            is_off := True
        ensure
            is_off_now: is_off
        end

    press_button
            -- Press the lamp button.
        require
            not_in_initial_state: not is_initial
        do
            if is_off then
                is_off := False
                is_on := True
                is_dim := True
            elseif is_on and is_dim then
                is_dim := False
                is_medium := True
            elseif is_on and is_medium then
                is_medium := False
                is_bright := True
            elseif is_on and is_bright then
                is_on := False
                is_bright := False
                is_off := True
            end
        ensure
            state_changed: old is_off /= is_off or
                           old is_dim /= is_dim or
                           old is_medium /= is_medium or
                           old is_bright /= is_bright
        end

feature -- Status report
    state: STRING
            -- Current state of the lamp as a string.
        do
            if is_initial then
                Result := "initial"
            elseif is_off then
                Result := "off"
            elseif is_on then
                if is_dim then
                    Result := "on.dim"
                elseif is_medium then
                    Result := "on.medium"
                elseif is_bright then
                    Result := "on.bright"
                end
            end
        end

invariant
    valid_state_combination: is_initial implies (not is_off and not is_on and not is_dim and not is_medium and not is_bright)
    off_state_valid: is_off implies (not is_initial and not is_on and not is_dim and not is_medium and not is_bright)
    on_substates: is_on implies (is_dim or is_medium or is_bright)
    dim_requires_on: is_dim implies is_on
    medium_requires_on: is_medium implies is_on
    bright_requires_on: is_bright implies is_on
    one_on_substate: is_on implies (is_dim and not is_medium and not is_bright) or
                              (not is_dim and is_medium and not is_bright) or
                              (not is_dim and not is_medium and is_bright)
end
```

For example in the Feature -- Transitions
you see that in the method `plug_to_wall` the pre-condition `requires` that the current state of the state machine be `initial`
Meaning you will get an error if you try to `plug to the wall` when the state machine is already connected.

Or, in the `press_button` transition observe that it `requires` to not be in initial but any other state, you can press the button.
But observe that in the post-condition `ensures` that if the state was `off` when we entered the method, then it should be `On` when we leave this function.

# Desired Characteristics for State Machine Implementations

What is the ideal approach?

Centralized State Management
:  The entire state machine and its transitions should be defined in a single location (as seen in Ragel).

Avoidance of State Explosion
:  The design should prevent the exponential growth of states, a common issue in hierarchical state machines (like Harel charts).

Visibility
:  The state machine should be clearly visible and accessible, similar to the Elm architecture.

Compilation Guarantees
:  It should provide the robust assurances of correctness offered by component-based approaches in Eiffel.

I'm writing this here so that I can come back and create my desired tool.
