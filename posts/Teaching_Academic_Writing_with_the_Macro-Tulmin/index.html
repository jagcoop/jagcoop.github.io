# **Teaching Academic Writing with the Macro-Toulmin Model**  
By Pepe Hernández. February 2nd, 2025  

"Why we didnt learn this way How to right academic papers?"
Alex shared with me his favorite way to write an article.
This is gold.

Enjoy the resume...

Learn from the masters, not from the students.

Kock, C., & Hegelund, S. (2003). *A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way.* In L. Björk, G. Bräuer, L. Rienecker, & P. S. Jörgensen (Eds.), *Teaching Academic Writing in European Higher Education* (pp. 317-331). Kluwer Academic Publishers.

------------------------------------


* Students often struggle to define the overall objective of an academic paper and fail to recognize how each section contributes to the paper’s overarching goal.  
* Instead of developing a coherent argument, they focus on isolated parts of the paper.  
* As a result, professors experience frustration due to the poor outcomes, but students feel EVEN MORE frustrated.  
* Toulmin’s method has not been particularly effective for justifying claims, as it allows justifications in arguments where none truly exist.  
* The proposed model adopts a macroscopic, top-down approach, emphasizing that an academic paper should be understood as a unified whole.  

This model serves both as an evaluation framework and as a heuristic tool for academic writing.  

A visual representation of the model is included in the article. Every academic paper should incorporate ALL the essential elements depicted in the diagram.  

## **Key Components of the Toulmin Method**  

### **Claim**  
* The central argument or conclusion the writer puts forward. It must be original rather than a mere repetition of previous authors’ statements.  

### **Data**  
* The evidence supporting the claim.  
* Any information that does not support the claim MUST BE OMITTED.  
* Counterevidence that could challenge the claim should also be discussed.  
* Types of data: theoretical frameworks, findings from other studies, or self-generated data.  

### **Warrant (Method)**  
* The method used to connect the data to the claim.  
* The justification must explain what data was collected, how it was gathered, how it was selected, and how it was interpreted.  
* Methods vary by academic field.  
* Professional competence is linked to mastery of research methods within a given discipline.  

### **Backing**  
* The rationale for accepting the chosen method.  
* Support may come from:  
  - Established experts.  
  - Previous studies using the same method.  
  - The method’s widespread acceptance.  

### **Rebuttal**  
* The identification of potential challenges to the method.  
* If data contradicts the claim, it should be addressed as part of the justification, not the rebuttal.  
* Ethical and professional integrity require explicitly stating the method’s limitations.  

### **Qualifier**  
* Indicates the degree of certainty of the claim.  
* Suggested phrases include: “this strongly suggests” or “a plausible explanation would be.”

## **GUIDE TO USING THE MACRO-TOULMIN MODEL**  
Students should reflect at different stages of writing (beginning, during, and finalizing):  
**“What do I have in each part of the model?”**  

This highlights the importance of Research Methodology—not just any methodology, but one tailored to the student’s field of interest, work, or expertise.  

> *"Framing an academic paper as a SINGLE ARGUMENT can help students use METADISCOURSE to clarify the overall structure of their paper."*  

Note: Although many academic papers contain multiple claims, they are often structured hierarchically.  

---

## **EXERCISE 1: Early Claim Formulation**  
1. Write freely for 8-10 minutes on the topic: *"The essence of my paper is..."*  
2. Refine the core idea into a single statement or question.  
3. Based on this statement, formulate the claim of your paper. Ask yourself: **“If I had to submit this paper tomorrow, what would my conclusion be?”**  
4. Read it aloud.  
5. *(Optional)* Choose the strongest claim for a full paper.  

## **EXERCISE 2: Analyzing Student Examples**  
1. Select three student papers.  
2. Read them silently.  
3. Identify the claim, data, justification, rebuttal, and support.  

## **EXERCISE 3: Playing Devil’s Advocate**  
1. What is the primary claim? Given the argumentation, is it reasonable?  
2. Are the data sources credible and sufficient?  
3. Does the method appear sound?  
4. How well do the method and rebuttal connect?  
5. Considering the rebuttals and supporting evidence, how valid is the claim?  

## **EXERCISE 4: Applying the Model to Your Own Paper**  
If all elements are addressed and aligned, the paper is on the right track.

## **EXERCISE 5: Evaluating Argument Structure in My Paper**  
*(Model examples, adapted from an archaeology paper, in italics.)*  

**Claim:** *“What is my central argument at this stage?”*  
- *Example: The ancient city of X directly influenced the architecture of city Y. Therefore, migration must have occurred from X to Y.*  
- **My paper:** …  

**Data:** *“What evidence supports this claim?”*  
- *Example: The bricks used in X and Y are identical to the millimeter.*  
- **My paper:** …  

**Warrant:** *“What method will I use to establish this connection?”*  
- *Example: A description of the process for selecting samples, measuring bricks, and determining their origin.*  
- **My paper:** …  

**Rebuttal:** *“What potential issues or criticisms exist?”*  
- *Example: The similarity in bricks could be coincidental rather than evidence of migration.*  
- **My paper:** …  

**Backing:** *“What supports the validity of this method?”*  
- *Example: The high improbability of such similarities being coincidental suggests a historical connection.*  
- **My paper:** …  

**Qualifier:** *“How strong is my claim given the rebuttal and backing?”*  
- *Example: It is highly probable that migration occurred from X to Y, but further evidence is needed.*  
- **My paper:** …

## **Conclusion**  
* The Macro-Toulmin model can be particularly useful in advanced academic settings where reading and writing research papers is required.  
* Some academic papers integrate these elements seamlessly, while others explicitly outline them in dedicated sections.  
* Reading scholarly work is not only about understanding its content but also about learning how to structure our own arguments effectively.  
* Using this model fosters critical discussions in academic reading, such as:  
  - *“Data X or Y does not support the claim made in the paper.”*  
  - *“A methodological objection is raised but not properly addressed.”*  
* The authors advocate for using the **Macro-Toulmin Model** in academic writing, urging students to shift their focus from isolated sections to a holistic, top-down approach to coherence.
