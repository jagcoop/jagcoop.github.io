# Don't Waste Your Time with Skeptics. Go With the Interested ones in Your Projects.

## Finding Radziwill again
The post https://www.dxquality.com/blog/don-t-try-to-win-them-over was written by Nicole Radziwill, an expert in Statistics that wrote the book "Learn Statistics with "R"." She is currently a consultant on Data Analytics. 

## The futility of your time with Skeptics
She points out the futility of Trying to Win Over Skeptics. She said that if she had read the book "Cascades. How to create a movement that drives transformational change", written by Greg Satell, she could have saved two months, a lot of agony, and about 150k USD.


## What to do instead
Trying to convince skeptic is hard because of their beliefs. They are influenced for factors beyond reason. Skepticism, is driven by emotional, psychological, and social factors. It is better to use that energy in other activities like:
- Trying to understand where skepticism come from understanding skeptic perspectives.
- Focus on those who are more receptive to the idea. 
- Invest your time on those who are willing to change their mind.
- Avoid unproductive discussions with skeptics.
- Shift the conversation to productive topics. 

## Convice others to do something good for them, is not good for you
After I read the post I realized when I waste time trying to convince someone to buy in an idea:
- I offer digitization services to the undersecretary of planning of Secretary of Education. We had a good service. It was ineffective.
- Right now, we have a group that writes a technology blogpost. From an approximately, 10, only 3 people have contributed to the 80% of the total blogposts (Thank you Pareto).
- I am trying to convince, my thesis director to work on a topic not related to the work she likes.
- All of this activities were waste. We couldn't convince the undersecretary to contract our service, our friends don't write for the blogpost, and my thesis director does not want to participate on the topic I propose.

## First trying to convice, then working with the interested ones
But I realized, I took the good choice other times, after spending some time trying to convince there were need for alternative ones:
I had a group of computer engineers that wanted to change the local government. We proposed to creat an Information Technologies agency. At the same time, the Accountability Secretary, and the governor in time (Amalia Garcia), wanted to offer physical kiosks to deliver digital services to citizens.
I remember I was in charge of the project. Andres Hoffman, was director of the magazine "Digital Politics", a Mexican magazine that promotes and inform about the IT successful trends and current initiatives in Mexico, and in the world in 2008. We had a call, and he told me. If you dont deliver on digital kiosks, it doesn matter what you propose for the IT Digital Agency. That is not what the governor was. I though about it, and knew he was ritght. So we focus on that project, and it was one of the succeses of that administration. Digital services in one place in several points of the states.
I worked for a project that the governor wanted. 

I remembar another ocassion, insted of working in the Secretary of Administration with all the government dependence, we focused in the internal needs. There were also, other small government areas that ask for help. We stopped to offer our innoations services to thos areas. We worked with the people who wanted to work with us.

The same happened when I worked as a lean-Kanban consultant at the Secretary of Education. In the Undersecretary of Planning, there were a lot of areas and needs. We focus on the area, and the area improved their performance for adopting good agile practices and methods (like Kanban). We worked when someone we wanted to work.

## A final thought
Thanks Alex for the blogpost. This is illuminating. 
We need to focus on the people who want to work with us, and with the people that share interests with use. It works on the personal level, in the professional level, and in the organizational level.
That way we will be using our time wisely.

Mental note: go directly with the interested ones in your initiative, avoid going with skeptics from the beggining.
