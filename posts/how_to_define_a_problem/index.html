                            **How to define problems**

We all have problems; they are everywhere and at every time.
So, how could we better solve problems?
Is there a silver bullet to solve any and all problems?

I think there is.



# Introduction
==============================================================================

Turns out that we know how to solve all the problems better:

> To ask the right question is already half the solution to a problem.
> Carl Jung.

So that's it!
To become better problem solvers, we need to ask better questions!

> How can we ask better questions?

In this article, we are going to explore three methodologies focused on how to ask better questions:

- IBIs Issue-Based Information System
- Theory of Constraints Thinking Process, in particular, The Current Reality Tree and the Cloud.
- TRIZ for going over contradictions


# Thinking methods

## Issue-Based Information System (IBIS)

The first methodology to ask better questions is IBIS.
In IBIs, they ask better questions by refusing to deal with a problem unless it's asked as a question.


For example, A person might say:

> I'm unhappy with my work.

According to IBIs, that is not a problem. A problem must be written in the form of a question:

> How can I be happy with my work?

or

> Why am I unhappy with my work?

or

> What makes me happy

In either case, each question is actually a problem, and we can actually propose Ideas to solve them:

### For example

``` mermaid
mindmap
	? How can I be happy at my work?
		* Ask for a rise
		* Transfer departements
		* Do the same work at a different company
	   ? What makes you happy?
		   * The outdoors
		   * Physical activity
		   * have a positive impact on society
		   * Money
```


In IBIs, there are rules on what we can write:

In IBIS, every problem is redacted as a question.
Then, below every question can only be an idea for a solution.
Or another question.
As a child to an Idea, there can only be Pros, Cons or other questions.
A Pro Con can only have as children another question.

### For example

``` mermaid
mindmap
	? what should we do about the one ring?
		* Give it to Frodo
			+ He has been carrying it already
			+ He doesn't have delusions of power
			- He is weak
			- He might fall pray to the ring as Gollum did
		* Give it to Gollum
			+ He has taken care of it for over 150 years
			+ He is invisible
		* Give it to humans
			+ Use the enemy weapon against him
			- The greed of man has failed us once before.

```


As you can see the mere constraint of having to write a problem as a question, already makes it easier to try to write options of a solution or a clarifying questions.

This is already more conducive to solving problems than just complaining.


But, sometimes we just know that we don't like the current situation, i.e. we can only complain! And express our dissatisfaction.

In that case, we can use the Current Reality Tree of the Theory of Constraints.
To bring to the surface the root problem.

## Theory of Constraints.

Ok, but how can we find the conflict?


The Current Reality Tree is TOCs method to voice the dissatisfaction that the different people have with the current situation.
Once everyone has voiced their concerns,
We can start to build cause-and-effect relationships between the concerns.
Then, one must appear as the root cause.
This root cause will frequently appear as the beginning and end of a feedback loop. (i.e., a Death spiral)

Once we find the root cause, we can write it as a conflict.
Then, we use the Cloud to try to solve it.


### The Cloud

In the theory of constraints, the tool to define a problem is called a Conflict Resolution Diagram.
But the nickname is the Cloud because once problems are properly defined, they evaporate.

In the Cloud, we start from the conflict.
I.e., Alice wants one thing, and Bob wants another.
And they simply cannot seem to be able to reach an agreement.

The next step in the Cloud is to understand the needs.

What does Alice *need* that is satisfied by her *want*
and what are Bob's *needs* that are satisfied by his *wants*

Then, we can identify the common goal. Both their needs want to be satisfied.

*           │                                │         *
*           │      ┌──────────┐        ┌─────┼───┐     *
*           │      │Bob's     │        │Bob's    │     *
*           └──────┼Needs    ◄┼────────┼─ants    │     *
*                  └──────────┘        └─────────┘     *

```

 Now, the Cloud is a super optimistic method of thinking with the following principles:

1. there is always a common goal.
 For example, if I want to go on holiday to the mountains and my wife wants to go to the beach.
 We could go our separate ways, and there wouldn't be any conflict.
 But we have the Common Goal of *spending time together*
 So we must find a *solution* that allows us to get what we need and spend time together.

 2. Only our *wants* our desires are in conflict. Never the needs.
 Again, everyone's needs are prerequisites to reach the common goal.
 So, in the Needs, there are no conflicts; they are prerequisites
 that a good solution must satisfy.

So, how do we solve a problem?

In the theory of constraints, the solution is to first:
Verify the Arrows.
I.e., the assumptions that create the relationships between concepts.
Sometimes, one of the arrows is not valid.
And we can move on.

However, more often than not, the arrows are valid.
And we must approach the conflict head-on.

In that case, we could use TRIZ to solve the conflict!!

## TRIZ

TRIZ is a Russian acronym that roughly translates to Theory of Inventive Problem Solving.
Legend has it that Genrich Artshulller studied 10,000 Russian patients.
Trying to extract the general principles that solve problems.

This led to the enunciation of the 40 principles of TRIZ
![Triz matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ#/media/File:40_principles_of_TRIZ_method_720dpi.jpg)

But before we can apply the 40 principles of innovation.
We must enunciate the problem as a contradiction.
A contraction is the idea of improving the solution in one dimension and making it worse in another.
But Both are needed!
The contradiction is the problem.

### Classic examples

#### Armor vs Agility::
  Ever since the knights mounted a Horse, they knew that heavier armor would protect them better.
  But making it heavier also makes the horses go slower and get tired faster.
  So this is a contradiction: we want speed but lightness.

  This problem is observed even today with Tanks and Jeeps.

  So, what solutions have been proposed to resolve this contradiction?

  For example, some thanks have "explosive" armor. That basically explode when a projectile is approaching the tank. The explosion is the protection, not the armor.

#### Area vs. Resistance

  In a boat deck we would like to have as much area as possible, to accomadate cargo, or even land a helicopter.
  But the wider we make a boat, the more friction that it will generate, and the more fuel that will be needed

  How can we have a boat that is wide above the surface but slim below it? With a catamaran.

So, that is how Triz approaches the definition of a problem. Just find the contradiction.
I.e., the attributes that you want and ask the question in terms of the contradiction.

# Leassons Learned

So, what have we learned?

In order to better solve problems, we need to:

- Ask better questions

To ask better questions, we need to:

a) Write problems and questions and

b) Find a contradiction

A contradiction is:

- When we *need* two properties at the same time, but improving one makes the other worse.

How can we find the contradiction?

- The TOC Current Reality Tree is a useful way to find the contradiction.

How can we solve the contradiction once it is found?

- With IBIS 40 principles.
