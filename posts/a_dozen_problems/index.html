     **My Dozen Problems**

What Feynman calls a Dozen problems,
I call my multi-annual obsessions.

There are topics / problems that continuously go back and forth in my head.
Those ideas sometimes decide to visit me at night
and when that happens,
I know the night is lost.
I'll spend hours trying to dissect the problem, back and front up and down.

On the other hand Steven Pressfield on his book: "The War of Art"
says that as Plato identified there is the world of Ideas,
the world of perfection.
And from that world the Muses (magical beings)
whisper into our ears what exist in this perfect world
So that we can create it in this physical world of ours.

But the Muses don't pick only one human.
On the contrary, they whisper to many of us.
And some have the sensitivity to listen to them.
some less have enough skill in their craft (music, poetry, etc.)
to be capable of actually implementing what the Muse inspire us to accomplish.


I suspect this is my case,
I can listen to the Muse,
but my skills are not good enough to actually,
translate that inspiration into something that exist in the world.

But that doesn't matter
I continue to practice,
Who knows, maybe one day
I'll be skilled enough.

So without further ado, let me share the problems that keep we awake at night.
Plus some tools that always help me to try to solve them.

# Problems

## Different perspectives for the same information
: I love this image:

    ![multiple persepectives](./shadow_cube_cas.jpg)

	It shows that the same object can be seen from multiple perspectives.

	Or in programming terms we can show the same data in multiple views.
	We can see a table, or a graph.
	We can see a Tree, or Kanban board.

## Other problems

* How to have successful software company?

* How to teach software project management?

* How to mix a virtual and physical kanban board?

* How can we automate natural construction

* How to automate processes in particular government processes?

* What is proper setup for working with computers (ergonomics) ?

* How can we make software documentation that works all the time?

* How can we have better alignment, between all the layers of software development?

* How to live comfortably in a small house or apartment?


In the coming days, I’ll expand on each of these problems and dive deeper into the tools and approaches I’ve found useful.

## What about you?

If you have a “dozen problems” that keep you awake at night or tools that help you tackle them,
I’d love to hear your thoughts.
Maybe together, we can find new angles to approach these challenges.
