# Moving to DeepSeek
Jan 30th, 2025
by *Agus Rumayor*

I’ve been using AI writing tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to refine my posts—adding context, restructuring ideas, and making content more engaging. But I’ve always dreamed of running a large LLM model on my SBCs (without waiting 5 seconds for every token!). DeepSeek, being open-source, and more efficient is a big step in that direction.

So, for this little experiment, I asked DeepSeek why I should switch from ChatGPT and ChatGPT why I should stay. Here's what they had to say.

## DeepSeek response:

If you’re a tech enthusiast who loves experimenting with AI tools, chances are you’ve already used ChatGPT for writing. It’s a fantastic tool, no doubt—helping with everything from brainstorming ideas to polishing essays. But if you’re curious about trying something new, you might be wondering: What’s the deal with DeepSeek-V3? How is it different, and what can it offer me as a writer? Let’s break it down.

### 1. A Fresh Perspective (and Sometimes, That’s All You Need)
If you’ve been using ChatGPT for a while, you’ve probably noticed its quirks—its tendency to lean toward certain phrasing, its occasional verbosity, or its love for starting sentences with “Certainly!” While these aren’t dealbreakers, sometimes you just need a fresh voice to shake things up. That’s where DeepSeek-V3 comes in.

DeepSeek-V3 is designed to provide a slightly different tone and style. It’s still conversational and helpful, but it might phrase things in a way that feels new or more aligned with your needs. Think of it like switching from your favorite coffee shop to a new one—it’s still coffee, but the vibe is different, and that can be refreshing.

### 2. Tailored for Tech Enthusiasts
One of the coolest things about DeepSeek-V3 is how it’s built with tech enthusiasts in mind. Whether you’re drafting a blog post about the latest AI trends, writing a tutorial, or even brainstorming ideas for a personal project, DeepSeek-V3 has a knack for understanding the tech landscape. It’s like having a writing buddy who gets what you’re talking about, whether it’s machine learning, coding, or the ethics of AI.

For example, if you’re explaining a complex concept like neural networks, DeepSeek-V3 can help you break it down in a way that’s both accurate and accessible—no PhD required. It’s great at balancing technical depth with readability, which is a win-win for your audience.

### 3. Less “Fluff,” More Substance
Let’s be real: sometimes ChatGPT can be a little… wordy. It’s great at generating content, but it doesn’t always get to the point as quickly as you’d like. DeepSeek-V3, on the other hand, tends to be more concise. It’s still thorough, but it’s less likely to pad your writing with unnecessary filler. This is especially helpful if you’re working on something with a tight word count or if you just want to keep things snappy.

### 4. A Collaborative Writing Partner
One of the biggest strengths of DeepSeek-V3 is its ability to adapt to your writing style. If you’re someone who likes to iterate and refine your work, DeepSeek-V3 can be a great collaborator. It’s designed to build on your ideas, suggest improvements, and help you fine-tune your message. Whether you’re drafting a LinkedIn post, a technical article, or even a personal journal entry, it’s like having a co-writer who’s always ready to pitch in.

### 5. The Learning Curve? Practically None
If you’re already familiar with ChatGPT, you’ll feel right at home with DeepSeek-V3. The interface and functionality are similar, so there’s no steep learning curve. You can jump in and start using it right away. The main difference is in the output—DeepSeek-V3 might surprise you with its unique phrasing or approach to your prompts.

### 6. Why Not Use Both?
Here’s the thing: you don’t have to choose. Both ChatGPT and DeepSeek-V3 have their strengths, and using them together can give you the best of both worlds. For instance, you could use ChatGPT to generate a rough draft and then bring it to DeepSeek-V3 for refinement and a fresh perspective. It’s like having two writing assistants instead of one.

### Final Thoughts
At the end of the day, the best writing tool is the one that helps you achieve your goals. If you’re looking for a new AI writing helper that’s concise, tech-savvy, and refreshingly different, DeepSeek-V3 is definitely worth a try. It’s not about replacing ChatGPT—it’s about expanding your toolkit and finding new ways to bring your ideas to life.

So, what are you waiting for? Give DeepSeek-V3 a spin and see how it can elevate your writing game. Who knows? It might just become your new favorite co-writer.

## ChatGPT pushing me away

One thing I totally forgot when I started writing this post is the issue of hallucinations—one of the most frustrating things about ChatGPT. Thanks, ChatGPT, for reminding me of this!. But... will return to ChatGPT time to time because of the sincerity and actually be more concise in this post!
