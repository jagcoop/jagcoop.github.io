 **Learning by Observing**
**As a musician, the desire to improve on my instrument has always driven me to find the best and most comfortable way to learn. There are many ways, of course, but which ones? There are simple and complex, difficult or easy ways, and not all of them fit us or work for every occasion. Something that has helped me a lot as a music practitioner is learning by observing.**

*This weekend I had the opportunity to rehearse some pieces with my dad and some other cousins, and I realized how important it is to observe carefully and try to retain as much detail as possible of what we are seeing and hearing. This way, we can know what we have to do just by seeing it, as long as we have enough knowledge to interpret the hand mechanics in relation to the sound it produces, and in this way, we can replicate it to our liking and thus build or compose new chords or new ideas for musical interpretation.*

**In musical programming, I find that I can apply the same method when practicing musical coding through Sonic Pi.** *Being considered a musical instrument, as I described in another document, it is necessary to consider some techniques that we could use to better understand its execution, such as learning through observation. While researching the topic of live coding, I found several videos by Sam Aaron, the creator of this Ruby-based language, in which he is seen performing pieces programmed with Sonic Pi. It is amazing the wide range of musical values it has; we can do practically anything, and when focused on observational learning, we can take fragments from other programmers that catch our attention to practice with those codes, modify them, and create our own sounds. Each code gives us a very wide spectrum of sound malleability, with parameters for each sound effect, being able to change everything. Furthermore, observing a programmer coding a musical piece live gives you a clear idea of how a programmed music interpretation should be carried out. Just like a guitar or a bass, which is the instrument I play, our instrument is the computer, and what is shown on the screen are the "strings." The musician wants the viewer to see their fingers moving between the strings creating music, so the programmer projects the code being "played" while the music flows through the keys.*


Learning by observing, also known as observational learning or vicarious learning, is a way of acquiring knowledge and skills through observing the actions and behaviors of others. This form of learning is fundamental in human development and is one of the bases of social learning.

### Learning Process
- **Attention:** First, you need to pay attention to the person or activity you are observing.
- **Retention:** Then, you need to retain or remember what you have observed.
- **Reproduction:** After that, you try to reproduce or imitate the observed behavior.
- **Motivation:** Finally, you need motivation to perform and repeat the behavior.

### Models to Follow
- **Parents and Teachers:** Children often learn by observing their parents, teachers, and other authority figures.
- **Peers:** People can also learn by observing their peers or companions.
- **Media:** With television, the internet, and social media, it is possible to learn by observing people from all over the world.

### Benefits of Observational Learning
- **Efficiency:** It can be faster and more efficient than learning by trial and error.
- **Safety:** It allows learning behaviors without having to experience the negative consequences of mistakes.
- **Adaptability:** It facilitates adaptation to new situations and environments by observing how others face similar challenges.

### Applications of Observational Learning
- **Education:** Teachers use demonstrations to teach practical skills.
- **Work:** New employees can learn by observing more experienced colleagues.
- **Sports and Art:** Athletes and artists learn techniques by observing professionals.

### Influence on the Development of the Musical Programmer

#### **Fundamentals of the Language**
- **Basic Understanding:** A programmer needs a basic understanding of the programming language they are using. In the case of Sonic Pi, this includes understanding the basics of Ruby, which is the underlying language.
- **Syntax and Commands:** Familiarizing oneself with the syntax and specific commands of Sonic Pi is crucial to interpret and replicate the observed code.

#### **Practical Application**
- **Imitation of Examples:** By observing other programmers, a learner can imitate specific code fragments and techniques, speeding up the learning process.
- **Experimentation:** Applying what has been learned by observing, and experimenting with personal modifications, allows for deeper understanding and personalization of knowledge.

#### **Creativity and Adaptation**
- **Development of Own Style:** Once the learner has a solid foundation, they can begin to develop their own style and unique techniques, based on what they have observed.
- **Innovation:** Observation not only allows replication but also inspires the creation of new ideas and approaches.

### Feedback and Iteration
- **Error Correction:** Observing how other programmers solve problems and correct errors can help the learner develop problem-solving skills.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback from observed peers or mentors can guide the learner in improving their skills.

### Benefits of Observational Learning in Musical Programming
- **Speed and Efficiency:** It speeds up the learning process by providing concrete and practical examples.
- **Adaptability:** It facilitates adaptation to different styles and techniques of programming.
- **Inspiration and Motivation:** It fosters creativity and motivation by seeing what others have achieved.

In summary, having a minimum base of knowledge is essential, but observation can significantly enhance the development of the musical programmer by providing practical examples, inspiration, and continuous improvement opportunities.
