     **What a mechanic understands about Free(dom) Software**

January 27th, 2025
By Alejandro Garcia

My father is 76-year-old mechanic, farmer and bureaucrat.
His daily drive is a 1982 Ford Bronco.
His older cars are 1970's Ford Mustang and a Chevrolet Corvette.
And he understands more about Free-software than  most of us, so-called software engineers.

Free(dom) Software as defined by the Free Software Foundation.
Is software that fulfills the 4 freedoms which are:

> The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
> The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
> The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
> The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

# The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

Would a mechanic buy a car, that he can only drive on city roads?
Of course not. Because a mechanic OWNS his car and can bend it to its will.
So why we as software engineers accept platforms that we can only use for certain approved purposes?

# The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).

Would a mechanic buy a car, that he cannot disassembly?
Of course not!
The mere idea that he couldn't disassembly his own car goes against
What makes him a mechanic.
How would a mechanic learn How cars work?
If he couldn't take one apart. And Could only read about how cars are made
Or if there were only "teaching" cars.
But the real cars he couldn't open the hood.

And some companies like John Deere and Tesla, are making it so that only their company employees can fix *your* car.
A mechanic would never touch those companies.

# The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).

Would a mechanic buy a car, that he *can't* later give to his daughter?
Of course no!
Because a mechanic understands that he *OWNS* his car.
To do with his car what he pleases.

And yet with software, and books, we happily accept that we cannot re-sell it?
Why?

# The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).

Would a mechanic accept a car that he cannot modify?
My Father's '82 Bronco was a 4x4.
He didn't like that suspension because He felt it was to rigid.
So he actually changed the suspension for softer one.
He has also changed the Engine at least 4 times.
and the drive shaft at least 3.
He changed the gear box so many times that he lost count.
Until he found one that felt exactly like he wanted.
And you know what?
He can give his truck to me if he so wishes!

Why would we take anything less from the software that we run?

# The biggest freedom of all

A mechanic knows:

> That he doesn't buy cars that he doesn't understand.
> He doesn't buy cars that come with planned obsolescence
> Or that are designed to limit his freedoms!

Now someone can make the argument, that that is all good for mechanics.
But most of the people are not mechanics, and don't know and don't want to know how their cars work.
So they happily take their car to the dealer, where they get charged handsomely for the most basic service.

And that is true. But the customer *doesn't have* to take their car to the dealer.
They can take it to a cheaper mechanic if they want.

So that is the biggest lesson of all:

> Don't buy car that you can't fix, or take to a mechanic that can fix it.
> Don't buy software that you cannot fix, or take to a software engineer to modify it for you.
> Especially if you are a mechanic, in the case of the former.
> and especially if you are a software engineer, in the case of the latter.
