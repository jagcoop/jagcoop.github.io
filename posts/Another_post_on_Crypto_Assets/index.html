# Another post on crypto assets
November 30th, 2024
by *Agus Rumayor*

This week, two friends approached me with the same question: Should I buy Bitcoin or any other crypto asset? My answer remains consistent: I never recommend buying something that creates artificial scarcity and isn't fundamentally being used to democratize finance. While crypto has the potential to revolutionize the system, the harsh reality is that much of it is driven by speculation rather than utility.

So, what does this mean for you as a potential investor or curious bystander? For me, it signals a perfect time to take some profits off the table. When I see the same kind of growth others are chasing, I often sell 10 to 15 percent of my portfolio. It's my way of locking in gains and reducing exposure to volatility.

But what if you're starting from scratch? You could take the opposite approach. Begin with a small, calculated investment—around 10 to 15 percent of the money you're willing to lose. Then, use a disciplined strategy: buy a little more of the asset you want to bet on every time it retracts by the same percentage (e.g., 10-15%) over a day or two.

If you’re approaching this for fun, potential gain, or even to gain knowledge, let me draw a comparison: it’s a bit like betting on your favorite game every weekend. My strategy here is the same. I started small, using the money I’d normally spend on my Friday tacos. If I lose, no tacos for me that week, which is admittedly painful! But if I win, it’s not only easier to enjoy my beloved tacos, but I can share them with friends and family, making the experience that much more rewarding.

The point is, whether it’s crypto or game bets, the key is to stay disciplined, set limits, and always be prepared for the possibility of a loss. Investing or betting should never come at the cost of your essentials—only with money you’re comfortable parting with.

Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with three important takeaways from this strategy:

1. Always share the gains.
When you win, share your success with others. This simple act shifts the focus away from greed or scarcity, bringing joy and purpose to your gains. Whether it’s celebrating with tacos, taking friends out, or giving back in some way, sharing transforms the experience.

2. Accept the loss.
Losses are part of the process, whether you’re betting on an asset or your favorite game. Even if it means skipping your beloved tacos for a week, this discipline strengthens your resilience and teaches invaluable lessons about managing risk. Personal growth often comes from how we handle setbacks.

Bonus tip: Bet against your favorite team.
This might sound counterintuitive, but hear me out: if your team wins, you’re thrilled. If they lose, at least you win the bet. Either way, you come out on top. It’s a playful strategy that keeps emotions in check and ensures a win of some sort.

At the end of the day, whether it’s crypto or casual bets, the key is to keep things fun, intentional, and within your limits. Always remember that the journey is as valuable as the destination—both in finance and in life.
