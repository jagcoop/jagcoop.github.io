# How to Hack Your Reading? Imitate Those with Good Habits

## How Not to Get a Good Book
Borrowing books from the library or buying from a bookstore is usually a bad idea. In the knowledge economy, there’s an overwhelming supply of books and topics. I reiterate, almost always, at least in my case, picking a random book off the shelf at Walmart or any bookstore is a poor strategy. Although sometimes you might stumble upon treasures or good deals. Personally, after 38 years, I’ve found a way to increase the number of books I read by following the advice of those who know better.

## Then, how to choose a book
So, How Do I Select Books That Contribute Most to My Growth? I’ve accumulated tips from a professional reader, and here’s a summary of the gems I’ve discovered by following these recommendations:

### Subscribe to Audible.com
This Amazon service offers a trial period for the first three months at $7. If you like the service, there are various plans. I’m subscribed to the one-credit-per-month plan, which is sufficient for me. Listening to one book per month guarantees at least 12 books a year! Plus, it helps you practice your English.

### Follow the masters, not the students 

There are iconic figures who are reference points for specific areas of study. For example, in Software Engineering, The Mythical Man-Month is a must-read. If Brooks writes another book, software engineers should read it. In the case of the Theory of Constraints, books or people recommended by Goldratt are safe references for experts in the field.

Derek Sivers is a born entrepreneur and has a couple of TED talks that I really like. He maintains a list of the books he’s read—over 100 of them—with rankings from most to least liked. I’ve already read almost all his five-star books, and they’ve practically become my favorites too. From his list, I picked up The Five Elements of Effective Thinking.

Bill Gates has a cool habit: during his summer vacations, he takes a pile of books and reads them all in two weeks. I don’t know how many he reads, but in the past two years, he has shared a list of interesting books, which I’ve added to my resource pool for selecting my next read.

### Recommendations from Friends
- Alex recommended to me several books along the way, including The Paradox of Choice, How Education Works, and The Toyota Way to Lean Leadership, among others.
- If You Like a TED Talk, Get the Book. This is another tip from "El Viejo." For instance, books I’ve read based on TED talks include The Paradox of Choice and Brain Rules for Kids.
- A Key Question: What’s the Best Book a Programmer Should Read? The answer: Code Complete. Additionally, there’s a list of 100 books every programmer should read. Here’s the link. Similarly, you should ask this question for the profession and topic you’re pursuing, always listening to those with a solid reputation.
- “I don’t read literature because I want to understand the world.” You can enjoy literature through movies. Although a book is almost always better than a movie, it takes five to ten times longer to consume.

A final question. The Print or the Digital on Kindle or Audible Audiobooks
This depends on the book and how fast I want to finish it. If I want to finish it very quickly, I buy it in two or three formats. This allows me to read practically anywhere—while waiting for someone, commuting, or as a bedtime read. If I want to take my time and the narrative is engaging, the audiobook suffices. But if the book is excellent, it’s worth having in physical format as well. If the book I want to read isn’t available in audio, I’ll buy it in digital format.
