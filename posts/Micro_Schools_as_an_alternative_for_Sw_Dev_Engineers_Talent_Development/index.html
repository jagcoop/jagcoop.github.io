# Reimagining IT Talent Development in Mexico: Innovative Alternatives to Traditional Training Models
By Alejandro Garcia and Pepe Hernandez November 22th, 2024

## Is there a human capital problem among software engineers in Mexico?
The first step to solving a problem is acknowledging it, so let's begin by asking: Is there a human capital problem in Mexico? Intuitively, the answer is yes, but let's dig deeper. As part of their projects at CIMAT, the authors interviewed 18 software entrepreneurs from the state of Zacatecas, and here are some reflections from their experiences:
- Only one of every 25 interviewees is worth teaching how to program (I.G., Tecnologías Dexa). In the case of Quarksoft, it's 30 to 1 (P.B., QuarkSoft).
- "I certified 45 developers in .Net, then I sent them for an exam to see if we could be an IT provider for a larger company. None passed the exam" (R.E., TopService).
- "From the moment of hiring, a recruit needs supervision for a year to start producing results" (R.C., ZacSoft).
- "The productivity and quality of a company's products and services are associated with the staff they hire" (F.C., Softlogik).
- "… there are no IT recruitment specialists either, so each company solves this problem their way" (P.B., Quarksoft).
- "There are fields like Community Manager and Social Media Specialist where there are simply no trained people in the market" (E.C., WSI).

## What is the problem?
Realizing the poor quality of graduates, companies have created or proposed alternative mechanisms to retrain them. At Quarksoft, they designed a six-month BootCamp to train engineers in technologies and quality models (P.B., Quarksoft). The Mexico First model aims to certify the use of technologies and quality models (A.R., Ministry of Economic Development).
- "Engineers graduating from public and private universities have no real experience in project development" (F.C., Softlogik).
- "We, as entrepreneurs, want to teach and influence the redesign of university curricula, in addition to having greater ties to improve the quality of graduates" (R.C., ZacSoft).

The need for more trained human resources is not exclusive to Zacatecas or Mexico; it occurs worldwide (Pankaj, 2010). Now, this is not a problem of the quantity of trained individuals, but a problem of quality. Our interviews also revealed that, according to the entrepreneurs' experience, recruiting a person takes between 25 and 35 interviews.

So now the problem transforms: How can we develop quality IT professionals in Mexico so that they can become productive and independent as quickly as possible in the companies that hire them?

## What are some solutions found in other countries
The situation of the shortage and low quality of IT professionals is not exclusive to Mexico, so it is worth considering how other countries addressed the problem:

### An ex professo University inside the Company: Zoho
Zoho is a Software as a Service (SaaS) company from India founded by Sridhar Vembu. Mr. Vembu faced the same issues as other graduates from Indian universities who were not prepared to develop professionally. Vembu decided to start with the principle that university graduates were unprepared for work, saying: "In fact, assuming that universities don't train is liberating because then we keep our expectations low and our recruitment and training systems are tailored to this reality."

So, Zoho established an internal training program within the company. They hired high school graduates who, due to economic reasons, were not planning to attend university and enrolled them in their training program, Zoho University.

The employees remain at Zoho University for two years, after which they become full-time employees. According to their internal evaluations, Zoho University graduates have the same skills as university graduates. Currently, 10% of Zoho's full-time employees are graduates of Zoho University.

Unlike Mexico, companies do not have schools to provide them with human capital and the specific competencies required to develop their products and services.

### Micro-schools in USA
Another case is micro-schools. These are high-quality institutions with reasonable tuition, small groups, and modest facilities. The goal of a micro-school is to train outstanding professionals in a single field at a reasonable cost, professionals comparable to the best schools in the US. Examples include the Magdalen College of Liberal Arts in Warner, New Hampshire, Shimer College of Literature, and Sterling College of Environmental Sciences, whose graduates compete in quality with graduates from prestigious US universities like Harvard.

The operational model of micro-schools requires specialists in a particular field, few students, and low administrative costs. Teachers themselves can perform administrative roles. In micro-schools, the student-to-teacher ratio is between 6:1 and 10:1. The cost is approximately $10,000 USD per year, far below the $50,000 USD that tuition can reach at other private universities.

Unlike the public and private universities in Mexico, the approach of micro-schools contrasts: We have generalists vs. specialists, large groups vs. small groups, and high tuition for prestigious universities versus the alternative of reasonable tuition but with even larger groups. As for facilities, the costs associated with building and maintaining most private and public universities are high.

## Studio Schools in the UK
Studio schools in the UK are another interesting case. Their primary goal is to keep high school students engaged in their education. Faced with this, they asked themselves: What would a high school look like where students wanted to be instead of trying to escape? Their proposal is the studio schools. These are high schools with at most 175 students, where the entire school focuses on a single theme. In some schools, the focus is multimedia; in others, it's sustainable development and information systems. To highlight, 80% of the subjects are evaluated based on real projects.

Studio Schools began in 2009 with two schools, grew to 10 in 2011, and by 2012, 35 were expected.

### The Conversion Program in the "Universidad Regiomontana", Mexico
On the other hand, in Mexico, I.G., now at Sygnus, a Monterrey-based company, shared that the quality of graduates has improved in recent years in Monterrey due to a conversion program at the Universidad Regiomontana, where students develop real projects in a scheme created at the university itself.

## Characteristics of a Mexican Micro-school
Based on the previous cases, we wonder how a Mexican micro school could develop talent in the software development field. We identified the following characteristics:
- Super-focused on a single topic, e.g., "Software Development."
- High mentor-to-student density, i.e., one mentor for every 7-10 students.
- Mentors are specialists in software development with at least 10 years of experience.
- Mentoring through pair programming, where students program with either a mentor or another student.
- Practice, practice, practice. That is, students participate in real projects.
- Accessible costs for both students and companies.

Thus, JagAcademy's proposal emerges: "It's a new program for software developers. Where practice, mentoring, teamwork, and real work take precedence over theory" (http://jagacademy.github.com/).

## Who is gonna pay the tuition in this new micro-school?
All the interviewed entrepreneurs agreed that an initiative like the one proposed at JagAcademy is necessary to develop talent. However, they also agreed on the main challenge for applying this model in Mexico: "self-sustainability." When asked directly whether they would pay university graduates to take part in the proposed program in the micro-school model, the majority of entrepreneurs answered negatively.
Some of the reasons given by entrepreneurs are:
- "Who guarantees that someone who takes the program will stay with me?" (R.E., TopService).
- "I don't have a budget for training" (P.B., Quarksoft).
- "The government needs to support companies in these initiatives" (R.C., ZacSoft).
- "It could be, but there should be tax incentives to invest in these programs" (F.C. , Softlogik).

Regarding JagAcademy's economic sustainability, we surveyed 40 engineering students or recent graduates to analyze their interest in the plan and the amount of tuition they could cover themselves. We concluded that the monthly payment could be up to 1,000 pesos per student (today it is almost 1800 for the inflation factor). However, they expressed interest in participating in such programs.

## Conclussions
Based on the authors' experience interviewing software industry entrepreneurs and studying innovative educational models abroad, we can conclude that:
- Micro schools are a viable alternative to developing human capital in the IT field.
- Some entrepreneurs have tried to address this need with their training workshops, like the BootCamp at QuarkSoft or the model at Universidad Regiomontana.
- Both entrepreneurs and students are interested in participating in a micro-school model.
- The main constraint for this type of model is that specialists with 10 years of experience must be willing or intending to participate in training projects.
- In other countries, such as the US, India, and the UK, this model has worked and is sustainable, given the cultural characteristics of those regions.

However, establishing such a model faces the following challenges:
- Financial sustainability. Mentors with 10 years of experience in software development charge higher salaries than what academia can offer.
- Entrepreneurs are not willing to subsidize students due to other risks.
- Recently graduated students need more resources to pay for such a scheme.
- The opportunity to increase collaboration between academia and industry goes beyond the current state of the people involved in the IT ecosystem, and its solution is not found in current approaches. 

As Einstein said: "We cannot solve a problem at the same level of thinking that created it." Therefore, innovative solutions need to be created. Micro schools, studio schools, and company-owned development centers are real alternatives for training IT personnel in Mexico, with the proper contextualization.
