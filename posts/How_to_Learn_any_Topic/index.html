Call me old school.
But I think that dominating any topic of knowledge.
Comes to find the right books.

# How to find the right books?

So this is my algorithm to find the best books to read about any topic.

First I just search in amazon, or audible for a book on the topic.
Here I don't fret a lot. Almost any book with good reviews will do.
Then I read the book and pay attention to the **references**.

There is a surely a **reference** that stands above the others.
So the next book I read is this reference.
That is probably one of the canonical books on the field.

Then after reading the second book.
Then, I search for a 3rd book, but this is the most difficult one.
Because this most criticize something about the other two.

It must be a contrarian.

# Why does this method work?

## Because we learn a lot from little information

In the essay [Why you only need to test with five users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/).
Jacobi Nielsen shows the learning curve of *usability tests*

![5 Users the Optimal Sample Size](./why-you-only-need-to-test-5-users-1.jpg)

This curve has many properties:

- Zero tested users there is zero learning.
- A single user your learning shoots up, and you already know 33% of the usability problems hidden in your design.
- With a second user you discover some new things, and some repeated things.
- By the third user you already know 65% of the hidden problems in your product.
- And with 5 users you are already discovered 80% of the problems.

And from that article we learn, that is better to 3 studies with 5 users each.
That a single study with 15 users.

Applying this to our current situation.
Just by reading that first random book, we are learning around 33% of what there is to learn about that topic.
Then the second book, the reference / canonical takes our knowledge to above 50% of what is there to know.
and The 3rd book, the **contrarian** takes our knowledge above 65%.

## Because we are at most 3 links from an important book.

And also from Networking Theory we know.
That if we take any random node in the network we are at most 3 steps from a highly influential node.

Which means, It doesn't matter which one is the first book we choose.
We will find the **Canonical** ones pretty fast.

For example, in this graph I searched for an obscure paper on *YooccLa* (Butler 2000)
And we can see that we are just one step away from a highly influential paper on ANTLR (Parr 1995)

# What is the catch?

## It is difficult to find the contrarian book.

I find it difficult to find the contrarian book.
Because it is by definition an isolated node in the network of knowledge.
So I have to really try and find it.

The way I do this is searching for "Critique" or "in response to" and the name of the author of the canonical book.

Sometimes I'm lucky and the random book I start with is the contrarian!

And that way, I have saved my self a lot of work.
Because, normally the contrarian authors are extremely well informed of the deficiencies of the canonical approach in the topic.
And the expose the canon, and why it is wrong.
It is a great way to learn!

## It takes a lot of time.

Imagine if before expressing any opinion.
Humanity had to read at least 3 books on the topic.
Almost no body would be able to express their opinions...
Wait, what? ... are we sure that is bad thing?
