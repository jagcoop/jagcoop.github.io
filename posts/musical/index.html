# A Musical Progression Pt1

Throughout my life, I've found myself in various musical situations that have pushed me to fully exploit my interpretative resources, whether it's when playing an instrument, learning a new piece, or studying another instrument.

## The Beginnings

To understand this, it’s important to go back to the beginning: when I was 12 years old, I started my formal musical education. Just like in all aspects of life, I began by taking baby steps with pencil and paper, learning the ABCs of music. This was an artistic awakening for me, but it was very limited at the time since I was unaware of the vast scope of studying music. Music is so rich and diverse that you can become a composer, performer, producer, arranger, or much more. Nowadays, I've also realized that programming shares a branch with music: **musical programming**.

## Resources for Musical Growth

### Practical Resources
- Musical instruments like guitars, pianos, drums, and violins.
- Sheet music with musical notation.
- Tools for recording and editing, such as software and equipment.
- Practice spaces like rehearsal rooms or studios.

### Technical Resources
- Interpretation techniques like vibrato, staccato, and legato.
- Applied theory like scales, chords, and harmonic progressions.
- Recording techniques like microphone placement, mixing, and mastering.
- Harmonization and arrangements to create musical structures.

### Theoretical Resources
- The history of music, including its evolution and various styles.
- Music theory with notation, rhythm, intervals, and tonalities.
- Psychology of music to understand its emotional impact.
- Sociology of music to analyze its cultural influence.

### Technological Resources
- Music software like Ableton, FL Studio, and Pro Tools.
- Electronic instruments like synthesizers, samplers, and MIDI controllers.
- Digital platforms like Spotify, YouTube, and SoundCloud for distribution.
- Learning apps like Yousician and GarageBand.

## Modern Musician Challenges

The best-known aspect of music for the average musician typically avoids the more technological side. However, for the modern musician, it's necessary to learn how to handle the technological resources that music offers. Here, I want to emphasize electronic musical instruments, including one that few people recognize or consider a musical instrument: **the computer**.

## The Computer as a Musical Instrument

A computer helps us create sound effects (such as those we hear in digital multi-effects processors like Line 6, Digitech, Zoom, Valeton, Neural DSP) and much more through programming languages like Faust, Haskell, or Sonic Pi. It allows us to create music at its most basic level—the reproduction of a single note with no process other than a simple sound. From there, we can build up to a massive symphony through **Musical Programming**.

## Sonic Pi: A Unique Instrument

Of course, everything has its own nuances, and for now, let’s focus on the experience of Sonic Pi. When I first began studying and exploring this language, I couldn't grasp the extent of what could be achieved (creatively speaking) when making music. I see Sonic Pi as not just a programming language but as a highly unorthodox musical instrument that must be treated and studied deeply, as we've mentioned before when studying methods.

### How to Learn Sonic Pi
1. **Reading and writing**: You need to understand and reason theoretically about what your program does in order to comprehend how it functions.
2. **Practice and experimentation**: Making mistakes and practicing again is key. Sonic Pi is a live coding musical language, which requires developing skills akin to those of a drummer or guitarist.
3. **Keyboard skills**: Changes in Sonic Pi should be treated like playing a piano—handling notes, melodic passages, harmonic structures, and rhythmic elements with care. Sonic Pi is a **polyphonic instrument**.

With consistent effort and creativity, Sonic Pi becomes not just a tool but an integral part of the musical journey.
