# A Musical Progression Pt1

Throughout my life, I've found myself in various musical situations that have pushed me to fully exploit my interpretative resources, whether it's when playing an instrument, learning a new piece, or studying another instrument.

## The Beginnings

To understand this, it’s important to go back to the beginning: when I was 12 years old, I started my formal musical education. Just like in all aspects of life, I began by taking baby steps with pencil and paper, learning the ABCs of music. This was an artistic awakening for me, but it was very limited at the time since I was unaware of the vast scope of studying music. Music is so rich and diverse that you can become a composer, performer, producer, arranger, or much more. Nowadays, I've also realized that programming shares a branch with music: **musical programming**.

## Resources for Musical Growth

### Practical Resources
- Musical instruments like guitars, pianos, drums, and violins.
- Sheet music with musical notation.
- Tools for recording and editing, such as software and equipment.
- Practice spaces like rehearsal rooms or studios.

## Modern Musician Challenges

The best-known aspect of music for the average musician typically avoids the more technological side. However, for the modern musician, it's necessary to learn how to handle the technological resources that music offers. Here, I want to emphasize electronic musical instruments, including one that few people recognize or consider a musical instrument: **the computer**.

## The Computer as a Musical Instrument

A computer helps us create sound effects (such as those we hear in digital multi-effects processors like Line 6, Digitech, Zoom, Valeton, Neural DSP) and much more through programming languages like Faust, Haskell, or Sonic Pi. It allows us to create music at its most basic level—the reproduction of a single note with no process other than a simple sound. From there, we can build up to a massive symphony through **Musical Programming**.

## Sonic Pi: A Unique Instrument

Of course, everything has its own nuances, and for now, let’s focus on the experience of Sonic Pi. When I first began studying and exploring this language, I couldn't grasp the extent of what could be achieved (creatively speaking) when making music. I see Sonic Pi as not just a programming language but as a highly unorthodox musical instrument that must be treated and studied deeply, as we've mentioned before when studying methods.

### How to Learn Sonic Pi
1. **Reading and writing**: You need to understand and reason theoretically about what your program does in order to comprehend how it functions.
2. **Practice and experimentation**: Making mistakes and practicing again is key. Sonic Pi is a live coding musical language, which requires developing skills akin to those of a drummer or guitarist.
3. **Keyboard skills**: Changes in Sonic Pi should be treated like playing a piano—handling notes, melodic passages, harmonic structures, and rhythmic elements with care. Sonic Pi is a **polyphonic instrument**.

With consistent effort and creativity, Sonic Pi becomes not just a tool but an integral part of the musical journey.

## Discovering Sonic Pi  

### Introduction  
In this section, we will take a closer look at **Sonic Pi**. We have already mentioned that this great tool allows us to turn a computer into a **polyphonic and polyrhythmic** musical instrument. Before understanding how to work with it, let's first explore its origins.  

 

### What is Sonic Pi?  
Sonic Pi is a music software designed for creating and performing music through live coding. It was developed by **Sam Aaron** and other collaborators (**Nesta, Alan F. Blackwell, Raspberry Pi**), with its initial release in **2012**. This program operates under the **MIT license**, making it open-source and accessible to everyone.  

From a technical standpoint, Sonic Pi is programmed in multiple languages, including **Ruby, Erlang, Elixir, Clojure, and C++**. Its graphical interface utilizes **Qt**, giving it a modern and functional appearance. The latest stable version recorded is **3.3.1**, released on **February 1, 2021**.  

The software is compatible with **standard MIDI files** for reading and editing, as well as the **Broadcast Wave format** for editable files. Sonic Pi merges advanced technology with an educational approach, making it an ideal tool for **teaching programming and music** in a creative environment.  



### Who is Sam Aaron?  
Sam Aaron is a **British researcher, programmer, and musician**, best known as the creator of Sonic Pi. He works at the **University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory**, where he combines his passion for technology and creativity. Aaron doesn't just engage in academia—he also performs **live demonstrations** using Sonic Pi, showcasing how coding can become a medium for creative expression.  

His academic work focuses on the **intersection of technology, music, and education**. At Cambridge, he has explored how technological tools can foster **creativity and learning**. His most notable project, **Sonic Pi**, was initially designed to **teach programming and music** in schools, integrating concepts of **live coding and musical synthesis**.  

Additionally, he has published **academic papers** in collaboration with researchers like **Alan F.
