# A Kanban Case Study in the Public Sector (Part I of N)

Octuber 14th, 2024
By Pepe Hernandez

By the end of 2017, several Department of Education administrative units had unspent budgets, and the fiscal year was nearing its end. Given the success of the Self-Construction Program team, the Zacatecas Education Agency decided to allocate unspent resources from other programs to the self-construction program. Thanks to this budget, the team could double the number of requests attended, a significant achievement considering that the annual resources needed to be more to meet all the needs of public schools. In the following years, the same phenomenon happened. The self-construction program used remanent resources from other programs. The team was proud of their Service's impact on the Zacatecas's childhood. 

It hasn't always been this way.

The Self-construction program was tripartite. The Education Agency of the State, the Municipal Governments, and School Parent Associations signed a legal agreement to participate in the program. The Education Agency provided materials and coordination through the Department of Self-Construction. The school parents' association provided social supervision. The municipal government provided labor. Some municipal governments signed an agreement and supported all the requests from schools with labor. Some of the work only needed the Parents' work and the materials provided by the Education Agency. 

The team was small: the Service manager (and other services), the supervisor coordinator, three supervisors, and the documentation specialist. There was a lot of work in progress or WIP (the work started but still needed to be finished). They didn't have a way to visualize the WIP. All they knew was that they were busy all day. They had a commitment to their purpose, but they felt stuck. But the natural explanation of reality was that the acquisition area was blocking our work. As humans look for a rational explanation of reality. We don't believe that it's our fault. It's somebody else. In this case, the acquisitions area was responsible for delaying materials. However, this limiting belief prevented them from acting on what was within their control.

Stephen Covey, author of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, states that **"when we think the problem is outside, that thought is the problem."** The team of the Self-Construction Program believed that the Department of acquisitions needed to be improved. However, this limiting belief prevented them from acting on what was within their control.

The introduction of a physical Kanban board revealed the partial truth. Of the 84 tickets in the "Preparing for Acquisition" column, only 37% of the work was pending acquisitions. The remaining 63%, or 139 tickets, had already passed through this phase and were in stages of building, finishing, and closing. With this new visibility, the team prioritized finishing those 139 tickets, freeing up space for new projects after the acquisitions area could do its job (acquiring materials from vendors). 

The team focused on following the Work In Progress in the columns ahead of the Acquisition in Progress step. The team needed to be more stable and was able to focus their attention on facilitating communication with stakeholders. The supervisor knew which requests required supervision, and the coordination area could make calls to update the state of the work. The team could detect external blockers, like delayed work due to unprovided municipal labor. Requests started to finish more frequently. The WIP decreased, and it was time to ask for help in the acquisition area. 

The head of acquisitions committed to attending weekly meetings to review the cases "blocked" by the area. In the first meeting, it became clear that his Department was a bottleneck. The team had labeled tickets with green stickers after each month, tickets had been spent in the acquisition process, and some had been stuck for six months or more, especially in public bidding cases. With this level of transparency, the acquisition area was aware of their importance in the process. They took action, and several tickets began to move. The head of the Department recognized the impact that waiting times had on project delivery.

There are several things I learned with this Kanban initiative, like
* Establishing gradually Kanban Core Practices
* Limiting the Work in Progress
* Finding the criteria for the work done Determining policies of the system
* Using metrics to manage a significant volume of work (Core Practice 3. Managing Flow)
* One Kanban Board to rule all the requests
* The Physical Kanban Board evolution
* From a physical Kanban Board System to a Digital Kanban System
...

I will talk about some of what I learned next week.
