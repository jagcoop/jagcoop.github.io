# How I fell in love with Serious Games for teaching Kanban (PART I)

## My first contact with Serious games

	"First experience, then theory." - Mike Burrows.  

Mike Burrows, author of Kanban from the Inside and Agendashift, said, "First experience, then theory." This is a powerful pedagogical principle.

We played the Get Kanban Game when I attended my first workshop with David Anderson from Kanban University in 2015. It was very engaging, and I also understood the game's mechanics. You can discover bottlenecks and identify several key concepts of the Kanban Method—everything in less than four hours. 

The Get Kanban Game is a serious game simulation created by Rusell Healy in 2011. Russel is a well-known Kanban specialist. He designed the Get Kanban game in the early days of Kanban and was awarded as a great contributor to the knowledge of the Kanban community. He was recently recognized as a Distinguished Kanban Fellow of Kanban University. 

You can buy the game at https://getkanban.com/.
- There is a free version of the game that you can print and play whenever you want. 
- There is a free online game version where you can play individually. You can play several times and change your strategy for better economic results. http://www.kanbanboardgame.com/ 

Note. There is a very different form of playing the game. That is for advanced players. "Improving GetKanban Scoreboards for Deeper Learning from the Game | by Alexei Zheglov | Medium." 

Since that firs time with Get Kanban Game, I fell in love with the general concept of **serious games**. The Get Kanban Game is a simulation embedded in a serious game. Simulations reproduce real-life settings to help players better understand the world (Gilbert & Troitzshn, 2005). Meanwhile, serious games focus on teaching players information or practicing specific skills while retaining the fun of the game. 

I used several times Get Kanban game. Every game, you learned something new. When I was preparing the first certification training course as an Accredited Kanban Trainer, I kept looking for more ideas about introducing Kanban to people. The GetKanban game is excellent for software development teams, software product teams, product managers, project managers, and Scrum Masters. However, it is not intuitive for other professionals. I've worked with public servants for a long time, so I needed more straightforward ways to introduce Kanban. I found a book that I enjoyed very much "Practical Kanban", writen by Klaus Leopold. There, I found simulations about building paper boats. While reading, I was sure that was a more straightforward, shorter way to introduce Kanban to people. 

I currently use GetKanban Game for the Kanban Systems Desing, but when I want to introduce the topic to people from different industries I use the Paper Boat Flow Simulation.


## The Learning Pyramid. A wrong and valuable model.
The Learning Pyramid said that the worst way to learn a topic is through a traditional lecture. On the other extreme, the best way to learn is by teaching. The second better way is through simulations or hands-on activities. The model makes sense, and supports the confirmation bias for me. I can learn better with games. Therefore, I started to look serious games and simulations for all my classes and workshops.

Unfortunately, the learning pyramid has proven to be ineffective. It was first proposed in a 1954 book called Audio-Visual Methods in Teaching, which the National Training Laboratories Institute developed. Empirically, I knew simulations were engaging, but learning things was not very effective. The model was wrong, but it was useful. When I use games and simulations, students engage with the topics. Even then, they could barely remember the key concepts. Nevertheles, that interest motivates them to give the method, principles, values, and practices a chance, and to be open for change. So, serious game are motivating, and engaging, but not effective for learning.

	"All models are wrong. But some are useful". - George E. Box.

In the thesis "A guide development for teaching Lean Startup using serious games," Ceballos, in 2021, created an instrument to evaluate learning from fundamental concepts of Lean Startup. The identification and comprehension of key concepts were very positive. Before introducing this tool, the questionnaire was only applied at the end of a series of plays, and the results were poor. Why did the introduction of a questionnaire before the serious game improve the learning results of the exercise?

## The right way to introduce serious games is to use proven methods, predict results, use spaced repetition, and predict results.

In his book, Small Teaching, James Lang remarks on the necessity of using the muscle of memory. When someone, even yourself, asks to remember something, you have more probability of remembering it. For example, James Lang attended a Starbucks for six months to buy frozen green tea. The same barista received the order day to day. When Lang asked what he would want, the barist could remember. But, the next day, the barista knew he wanted a frozen green tea. She could remember James, only when he ask her for his beverage.

The same principle was used for Ceballos in 2021. He made an initial questionnaire; it didn't matter what the participants answered. Some of them knew the topic, but not very well. But in the end, and during the process, they knew what answer they must look for during the game. This is a practical use of the prediction principle recommended by Lang in his book. Participants of a simulations, are aware of some specific questions, and while the evaluation happens students are answering the questions. As a side note, other valuable principles and practices are suggested in the Small Teaching book, like the interleaving principle (coming back to a specific knowledge) and spaced repetition practices, for example. This will be a topic for the following pòst. 

One of the things I like very much about Kanban training is the inclusion of good teaching practices, such as serious games, Case-Based Learning, and "Teaching from the Back of the Room," among others. This material would also be helpful for a future blog post.

Meanwhile we will be coming back to the Paper Boat Simulation workflow. How do you plan, how you execute, and how you close the simulation? We will answer the questions in the following blogpost.

ps. I realized we have a lot of capital in serious games.
- We have played the GetKanban Game more than a thousand times
- The same for Featureban and Paper Boat Simulation
- We have several sources of collections of Lean-Kanban Games and Simulations.
-- Kirill Krimov. https://kirillklimov.com/kanban-games/
-- Full metal agilist. https://fullmetalagilist.wordpress.com/2020/04/08/simulaciones-kanban-a-distancia/
- We have three Master's Thesis about Serious Games (Kanban, Lean Startup, and Playing Lean).
- We have sold workshops for college teachers on using Serious Games.

Why is that? We are constantly looking for better ways to teach and learn.
