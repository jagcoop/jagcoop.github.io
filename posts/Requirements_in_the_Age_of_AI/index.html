# Requirements elicitation in the Age of AI 
October 4th, 2024
by *Karina Chaires*

One of the greatest challenges in software development has always been defining clear and precise requirements. It is essential to have a thorough understanding of what needs to be built before jumping into the coding process. According to Wiegers[Wiegers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Wiegers), a requirement is a specification that describes some functionality, attribute, or quality factor of a software system. It may also describe any constraints on how the system is built.

At first, defining requirements may seem like a simple task, but in reality, poorly defined requirements can lead to significant frustrations and setbacks in a project. There are many well-established methods and a wealth of literature on how to properly manage this process. Below, I'll highlight some of the key requirements that, in my opinion, you should consider.

  ### Key Requirement Types

**Business Requirements**: These outline the goals of an organization.  
**Business Rules**: Policies, guidelines, or regulations that define or restrict aspects of the business. While not software requirements themselves, they often give rise to various software requirements.  
**Constraints**: Limitations imposed on the options available to developers for designing and building a product.  
**Functional Requirements**: Descriptions of behaviors that a system will exhibit under specific conditions.  
**User Requirements**: Goals or tasks that specific user groups must be able to achieve with a system or desired product attributes.

### Deliverables and Artifacts in the Requirements Process

Once the different requirements have been identified, the next step is to produce a series of deliverables that serve as documentation throughout the project. Some common artifacts generated during the requirements process include:

**Artifacts produced during the requirements process**:

- **Business Requirements**  
 - Background  
 - Business Opportunity  

- **Scope and Limitations**  
 - A table outlining the project's scope and limitations  

- **Business Context**  
 - Customer profiles  
 - Customer priorities  
 - Business model diagram  

- **Design and Documentation**  
 - General system structure  
 - Prototypes  
 - Table detailing functional requirements and constraints  
 - Context diagram  
 - Container diagram  
 - Component diagram  


### Moving Towards the Future with AI

Defining requirements is a process that can be either highly abstract or extremely detailed, but the goal is always the same: to have a clear roadmap before execution begins. As artificial intelligence becomes more integral to various industries, there's a possibility that AI could one day help resolve this issue by predicting or even generating requirements based on data from stakeholders, potentially eliminating the guesswork from the process.

However, until that time comes, it's important that we continue to apply established best practices in software development. Proper requirement management is crucial for building successful systems that meet both business needs and user expectations.


While tools and methodologies have evolved, the human element remains critical. Clear communication, regular feedback loops, and a deep understanding of business objectives ensure that requirements are not only defined but refined throughout the project's lifecycle. As AI tools begin to assist in automating aspects of requirement gathering, the role of developers and stakeholders will shift towards validating and contextualizing those requirements to ensure alignment with the project's goals. By blending human insight with emerging AI technologies, teams can create more efficient, accurate, and adaptable software solutions that better meet user and business needs.
