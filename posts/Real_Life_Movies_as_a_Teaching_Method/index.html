# Real Life Drama movies as a training and teaching method
By Pepe Hernandez, December 26th, 2024.

Yesterday Alex told me. Somebody is teaching recursivity like you taught in high school.

I said, joking, "If someone sees you doing something, surely they will copy you." 

Yes. I used to watch movies with my students to teach them something.
I started as a teacher in a basic school in ninth grade.
I teach algebra as a substitute teacher for the last semester of the third secondary grade.
Here in Mexico, we have the primary school, six years (from 6 to twelve years of age)

That reminds me that I need to list the movies I like to teach something. I also need to include real-life films and some series. 

I remember three places where a movie has been helpful. 

My preferred genre is a drama based on actual story movies.

## Movies for teaching in Highschooll.

1. Pirates of Silicon Valley: The story of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs (and Wozniak) stealing the ideas of Bell Labs and creating both technological empires. The History of computing is a critical topic in our technological life.
2. The Social Network is also a digital era and business story. They could see Zuckerberg's legal disputes against Bardo Sabering and the Winklevoss twins. You can learn from digital History.
3. Moneyball. It shows the importance of understanding a problem and how the paradigms are wrong. When someone is obsessed with truly understanding the world, it could change an industry. Billy Bean and Paul De Podesta changed the baseball world with a better economic model. Moneyball is a classic of the power of the right measure for success in an industry.
4. Inception, to teach the concept of recursivity to students in the programming class.

## Real Life Movies

2. The woman and the sea
3. The perfect game
