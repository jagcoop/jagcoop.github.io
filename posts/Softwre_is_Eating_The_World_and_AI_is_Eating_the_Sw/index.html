# The importance of Software Industry in the World.
By Pepe Hernandez. January 27th, 2025

After the essay of Mark Andreessen in 2011 "Why Software is eating the World", many things had happened.
In 2011, the most successful companies were software driven...

Pixar led the industry over Disney (Disney had to acquire Pixar to stay relevant)
Google led the marketing industry
Zynga led the game market with Farmville
iTunes, and Spotify led the music market
Amazon, led the retail market.
Amazon, led the book market.
The book market transformed to digital.
Every financial transaction is done by software. 
The leading software companies in the world are American.

Andreessen identified several challenges at that time:
- 2010's were hard economic times. Stronger companies grew from this times.
-Many people in the US, and around tow or lack the educations and skill required to participate in the great new companies coming out of the SW revolution.
- A lot of companies were born in that years, but showing true value for customers, was not easy.

Andreessen mention a pair of thoughts about software industry.
1) Other companies needed to understand what successful SW companies were doing.
2) He was sure about how key SW companies would thrive

In 2019 Tarry Singh, Former contributor of Ford published a derived article from the Andreessen article "Software Ate the World, Now AI is Eating Software)

Nobody understood Andreessen in his 2011 essay. 
Singh argued that "Little envision that the same software industry could be at risk of being eaten".

From 2011 to 2019, AI maturity, and important factors were solved to overcome the constraints.
- Cost of Cloud Storage
- Big data sources (data lakes, from example)

Examples of successful AI applications
- AI-startups in the transportation crated value by optimizing shipments.
- Code completion tools, like Tab Nine, TypeSQL, and BAYOU....
-- Tab Nine learned from 2 million files from the code repository of GitHub
One Tab Nine achieved that, Jacob Jackson realized the parallelisms between code and natural language and created GPT for Open AI.
