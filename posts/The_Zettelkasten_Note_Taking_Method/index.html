# My Zettlekasten Experiment Part 1 of 2 (the plan)

## The problem. My Note Taking Method is not adequate.
Yesterday, I was thinking of the minimum things I must do daily to deliver the required PhD advances. 

Alex told me I need to write a page daily, and then I will have 365 pages in a year.

It's good advice and common sense.

But it sees a little chaotic.

Let your brain order the knowledge you acquire.

But, as James Clear says, we don't need goals; we need systems.

I need a system to write small interconnected pieces. Lego pieces that I will use to build something betters.

The goal of a note system should be to allow you to build something meaningful quickly. 

When you use a traditional note-taking system or a popular app, the number of notes grows chaotically. 

In order to build something meaningful, you need a system that connects ideas and has structure. This system must work similarly to how your brain makes connections.

I need a system that would allow me to do generate information, retain information effectively, and make note taking and learning creative.

Alex recommended Zettlekaste to me some time ago... It's time to use it.

## What is Zettlekasten?

Zettlekasten is a note-taking system. It is a word in German that means "Box of cards".

Luhman, a German sociologist and exceptional scholar, created Zettlekasten as his tool for writing productivity. Due to his system, he outperformed others. He wrote 58 articles in thirty years and four hundred articles.

Zettlekasten allows you to
build a web of knowledge
find connections between topics
to retrieve the right memory,
and to develop ideas and arguments
 
To implement this technique in the physical world, you need two boxes: 
- a reference box with literature notes and
- a main box for ideas (fleeting notes), theories, arguments, and discussions (permanent notes).
 
### The types of notes
There are three types of notes:
- Literature notes
- Permanente notes
- Fleeting notes

### Advice to take literature notes
1. Keep it short. Extremely selective, <3 sentences
2. Write in your own words. No copy and paste!
3. On the side, bibliographical notes; on the other, bibliographical reference.

### Make permanent notes
* Add all the notes related to certain topics?
* Add how it is related to what you know.
* Add how it supports or adds value to your existing ideas.
* Add what you just learned with what you already know.
** How does this idea fit into what I already know?
** Can this be explained by something else?
** How does X mean for Y?
** How can I use this idea to explain Z?

### **About hashtags:**
Find keywords to retrieve it. In which circumstances do I want to stumble upon this note? When and how will I use this idea? Which things am I working on or interested in?

### **About references:**
* File each one behind relevant notes
* Add links to relevant notes
* Index to make them easy to discover later

Additional advice. Take fleeting notes (notas fugaces)

### **Step 4. Review and repeat.**
* What is missing?
* What questions arise?
* You don't have to start from scratch with this method.

### Some Tips to Start
- Read the book "How to Take Smart Notes". It includes the basics of Zettlekasten.
- Find an app of your choice -> Obsidian
-- Try Obsidian. It's a popular visual tool. 
- Don't transfer all your notes; just experiment. 
- Write for new ideas and experiment for some time.
- Use it for a project.

## The challenge. 
Use it for 180 days to see what happens with my PhD Thesis.
