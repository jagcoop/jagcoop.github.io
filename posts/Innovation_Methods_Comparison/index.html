# Innovation Methods Graphical Comparison
By Pepe Hernández, November 14th, 2024

## Most known Innovation Methods
Recently I gave a pair of classes on line about Design Thinking. Design Thinking is the Designer approach for an innovation method. In order I discovered first TRIZ en 2010, TOC thinking process, Six Thinking Hats, Google Design Sprint, and lately Design Thinking. Along the way after discovering a new method a questions arises. Is there a better method? Is there an universal method? Which is the adequate criteria to compare them?

Design Thinking is method designed by IDEA, an innovation company that has clients like Apple, among others. At a first glance, Design thinking differentiatio from other for its strong user centric approach. On the other hand, TRIZ is no user centric. It starts with a technical contradiction or a phyisical contradiction. A technical contradiction means that when you try a solution in a problem you will obtain gains, but also cost and harms. Something improves, and something gets worse. A physical contradiction means that you need to obtain two different states of something. I want hot coffe (for drinking), and I want cold coffe, so I dont burn my hand.


## Innovation Methods Characteristics Definition
User centricity, definively is on aspect, but  are there other criteria that can help us to differentiate those methods. Yes these are some of basic characteristics determined for innovative methods:

**1. Focus on Problem Solving.** It measures how effectively the methodology identifies and addresses specific problems. High-scoring methods provide systematic approaches to solve complex issues.

**2. Encourages Creativity.** Assesses the degree to which the method fosters innovative and out-of-the-box thinking. High scores indicate methods that prioritize ideation and divergent thinking.

**3. Iterative Process.** It evaluates whether the methodology emphasizes repeated cycles of experimentation, learning, and refinement. Iterative processes improve solutions through continuous feedback.

**4. User-Centric.** It determines how much the methodology focuses on understanding and addressing user needs and feedback. Higher scores reflect direct user engagement.

**5. Structured Framework.** It indicates the presence of a clear and systematic approach to applying the methodology. High scores imply well-defined steps or tools.

**6. Emphasis on Rapid Prototyping.** It measures the method's ability to quickly develop and test prototypes to validate ideas or solutions. Essential for methods that prioritize speed in experimentation.

**7. Decision-Making Enhancement.** It reflects how well the methodology supports structured and informed decision-making. Higher scores mean improved clarity and reduced biases in group decisions.

**8. Root Cause Analysis.** Focuses on identifying the underlying causes of problems rather than addressing superficial symptoms. High-scoring methods delve deeply into system inefficiencies.

**9. Focus on Reducing Risk.** It evaluates the methodology’s effectiveness in mitigating risks through experimentation, validation, or optimization. Methods with high scores emphasize de-risking early and often.


## Comparision of the Innovation Methods against characteristics
With these criteria, I asked ChatGPT to compare all the methods, and assign a grade in each of them for each method.

![Innovation Methods Comparison Radar Diagram](radar.png)

In the Radar Diagram I you can differentiate between two grups. The tools created for the group with strong design background: Design Thinking, Google Sprint, and Lean Startup.
* User-centricity is a key component of thise group.
* An Emphasis on rapid prototyping to reduce uncertainty and validate your hyphotesis (definitively, a practical scientific approach)
* The iterative process, the lean-agile approach, is another big influence of this group.

The second group differentiate from the other for its more technical approach.
* TRIZ, and TOC are simmilar on Root Cause Analysis. I can say, that both try to understand the problem in a rationale way. Both of them foculs in atacking internal constrain to look for more ideal solutions.
* TRIZ and TOC Thinking Process excel in internal constraints optimization due to their structured approaches to identifying and resolving inefficiencies.

Note. Ideality is a principles used by TRIZ. Ideality is the sum of the benefits divided by the sum of the costs and harms. It serves to evaluate every state of a system to verify if a system after a certain change have more idelity versus the current system.

* In this second group TOC and six thinking provide principles, tools, and processes that enhance decision making.

## User Centricity vs Optimizations of System

The two dimmensionas that has the higher difference between those two groups are user-centricity, and root cause analysis. The root-cause analysis is related to reduce internal inefficiecies or constraints. So I asked CHATGPT to elaborate a two dimension diagram. First dimension specifies the Optimization of Internal Constraints, and the other axis the User-Centric approach.

![User-Centric vs High System's Diagram](two_dimmension.png)

This diagram is very clear. There are two types of innovation methods. Those centered on the technical aspects, and those centered on the user.

There is a special case. Six Thinkin Hats is graded low on both dimension. But, it is the first on decision making enhancement.


## Next release. Assigning a description to each scale point of each dimension
An improvement to this exercise could be to assing a description for each point of the scale for each dimension. It could be represented as follows as a first approach.

It can look like this:

**1. User-Centric Dimension.** This dimension measures how methodologies engage with users to understand their needs and behaviors:

|Score	|Description						|Example
|1.0	|Highest: Shadow users in their natural environment. 	|Ethnographic studies or contextual inquiries.
|0.8	|High: Focus groups. 					|Group discussions to gather collective insights.
|0.6	|Medium: Interviews. 					|One-on-one conversations with users.
|0.4	|Low: Questionnaires					|Standardized surveys or polls.
|0.2	|Lowest: Don’t talk to users				|No direct user input is considered.

**2. Encourages Creativity.** This dimension assesses the extent to which the method stimulates out-of-the-box thinking:

Score	Description	Example
1.0	Highest: Dedicated brainstorming sessions	Freely generating ideas without constraints.
0.8	High: Structured creative workshops	Using frameworks like SCAMPER or Six Hats.
0.6	Medium: Creative tools introduced selectively	Creativity supported in specific phases.
0.4	Low: Creativity emerges indirectly	Focus on incremental changes.
0.2	Lowest: Focus on predefined solutions	Minimal emphasis on innovation.
3. Iterative Process
How much the methodology relies on cycles of refinement and learning:

Score	Description	Example
1.0	Highest: Continuous, rapid iterations	Lean Startup with build-measure-learn cycles.
0.8	High: Frequent iterative cycles	Agile sprints or Design Sprint iterations.
0.6	Medium: Iterations between major milestones	Reviewing progress at significant stages.
0.4	Low: Limited iteration	Iterations primarily for corrections.
0.2	Lowest: No iteration	A linear, one-time process.
4. Structured Framework
This dimension evaluates how methodically the process is defined:

Score	Description	Example
1.0	Highest: Highly defined stages with clear steps	TOC Thinking Process, TRIZ.
0.8	High: Well-defined frameworks	Design Thinking, Design Sprint.
0.6	Medium: Semi-structured processes	Lean Startup with adaptive guidelines.
0.4	Low: Loose frameworks	Conceptual phases but little detail.
0.2	Lowest: No formal structure	Ad-hoc or improvised processes.
5. Root Cause Analysis
Measures the extent to which the method delves into the root causes of issues:

Score	Description	Example
1.0	Highest: Systematic analysis of core issues	TRIZ, TOC Thinking Process.
0.8	High: Structured problem-solving	Six Sigma tools like fishbone diagrams.
0.6	Medium: Focus on identifying key contributing factors	Lean Startup experimenting hypotheses.
0.4	Low: Superficial root cause exploration	Brief analysis but lacking depth.
0.2	Lowest: Symptom-focused approaches	No deep exploration of root causes.
6. Decision-Making Enhancement
How well the method improves decision-making quality:

Score	Description	Example
1.0	Highest: Multi-perspective decision framework	Six Thinking Hats explicitly enhances decision-making.
0.8	High: Decision support tools	Frameworks to balance pros and cons.
0.6	Medium: Improved decisions via structured approaches	Design Sprint or Lean Startup decisions.
0.4	Low: General decision-making improvements	Methods indirectly lead to better decisions.
0.2	Lowest: No explicit focus on decision-making	Primarily process-driven methodologies.
7. Focus on Problem Solving
Measures the extent to which the method solves immediate problems:

Score	Description	Example
1.0	Highest: Directly tackles and resolves problems	TOC Thinking Process and TRIZ.
0.8	High: Problem-solving as a core feature	Design Thinking problem identification.
0.6	Medium: Solves problems through iterations	Lean Startup solutions emerge from learning.
0.4	Low: Problem-solving secondary	Indirect through innovation or decision.
0.2	Lowest: Minimal problem-solving	Focused elsewhere, e.g., strategy.

## Conclusions
I have to review each of the descripction for the points of the scales, but its enough to understand in which, and why each method has that idea.

	This is not the perfect diagram, but as Geroge E. Box said "All models are wrong, but some are 	useful".

I hope this comparision could be useful for you.

For me is enought to be clear about the existence of two grupos (user centric group, and the optimiziations of inefficiencies group). A third group could be the decision enhancment group with TRIZ, TOC, and Six Thinking Hats.

Experts understand simple concepts deeply, that is a principle of High Effective Thinking.

These two diagrams clarify some of my thoughts, and allow me to share it with the community.

You don't need to have all the answers, you need to know how to ask.

Enjoy it.
