# Manage complexity behind simple interfaces

This is a follow up to the first post on [Understanding complexity in Software Systems](https://jagcoop.github.io/posts/Understanding_complexity_in_software_systems/) where we mentioned that a good software design is the one that reduces complexity of the system; complexity being anything that makes the system hard to understand and therefore modify.

In general, we can refer to the components of a system as &ldquo;*modules*&rdquo; and we can categorize them in mainly two groups, deep modules and shallow modules. The distinction comes mainly, from the size of the module interface and how well does it hide irrelevant details for most users of the module behind a properly designed interface. The reason on why this is of importance comes after the realization that complexity - while it can take many forms - the one area where it tends to creep-in is at the boundaries of modules, that is, at the interfaces. This is a key insight for software developers to grok - master the interfaces and keep complexity at bay.

To better understand what we mean by interfaces, recall that a software system is primarily an amalgamation of components, and for this to work every component in the system must expose some kind of interface, this is what tells users (and other modules) how are they supposed to use the &ldquo;thing&rdquo;, let it be a function, a method, a class, a package, a service, or a system on its own; all of these *objects* expose interfaces so that consumers know how to consume them.

Now, bringing it back to the categorization of modules, *deep modules* are the ones that hide a lot of complexity behind a simple interface so that users aren&rsquo;t bothered with understanding or even knowing about such complexities. A real-world example of a good deep module is the Linux I/O subsystem, there, users need only to know of about five system calls to do I/O interaction, mainly with files; programmers are often able to get away with just four of them, `open()`, `read()`, `write()` and `close()` (`lseek()` is the fifth one in case you were wondering). Behind these system calls there is a lot of complexity hidden that manages permissions, entries on a virtual file system, storage devices, memory mapping, and more, all of which is invisible to users.

In contrast to deep modules there are *shallow modules*, these are components of a system in which the interface leaks a lot of information about the implementation details of the thing, or worse, modules where the interface ends up being more verbose than the implementation of the module it self. Such small components shouldn&rsquo;t even exist, specially if used just in a couple of places through the codebase.

The information exposed by the interface of a module should be as small as posible without the need to make users understand the implementation of the module. This is the basis of the information hiding principle - an idea that has been preached before in other areas as well, &ldquo;the principle of the least information&rdquo;, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make me think&rdquo;, etc.

In short, having simple interfaces is the secret sauce behind modular software, focus on defining small and simple interfaces and strive for deep modules that hide a lot of information users need not to care about; even better if we can still expose advanced functionality to power users through a different interface for those who need *more* out of the module, coming back to the  Linux I/O subsystem example - while rarely used - `lseek()` provides tighter control when reading files that some users might care about, specially the ones seeking to achieve higher performance or highly optimized programs.

In conclusion, by following these principles we will then make composition of modules on a system easier, just as we would like our jobs to be.
