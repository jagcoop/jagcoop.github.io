# Creating Software AI Products, the AI Product Management Way.
By Pepe Hernandez. December 13th, 2024

Today Alex came at 5.00 with a WhatsApp message: Look at this post, Andrew NG thinks that your thesis theme is good: Product Management with AI.

Andrew NG! What did he said? While I am studying the PhD, I have doubts about my topic. In fact I have  tried with five different topics. 

When Alex recommend something, I am 99% sure the recommendation is good.

-------------------

In his recent blogpost, Andrew NG talks about new patters in the Product Management discipline due to the enabling AI tools. He refers to the AI Product opportunities. The tool is an AI tool, the product is an AI product. This change of the market, and the change of the tools enables new practices.

NG asserts that "AI Product Management is evolving."

	"The growth of generative AI and AI-based developer tools has created numerous opportunities 	to build new kinds of things, among them AI applications". 

This new way of creating things is driving shifts in best practices in Product Management, because WAHT IS POSSIBLE TO BUILT has shifted. 

Note. I like the definition of Andrew NG (Product Management is the discipline of defining what to build to serve users).

## 1. Use concrete examples to specify AI products.

When a requirement is vague, and general, Artificial Intelligence can generate anything. To have better results, we need to be more specific. By providing examples or scenarios, AI can generate something that includes the based scenarios. The more scenarios, the better the outcome of AI tools. 

Note. By the way, last week Alejandro GarcÃ­a wrote about how examples, or scenarios are the base of TDD (Test Driven Development), and how Bertrand Meyer is skeptic about them. Bertrand Meyer prefers a formal specification (Design By Contract). Alex reflects about this two points of view, and arrive to the specific cases where each of them is a better approach, including when to use both at the same time. Check the blogpost here -> https://jagcoop.github.io/posts/tdd_cloud_wilkinson_vs_meyer/ 

A PM can literally take pictures, and write notes about what is happening. The AI can identify the scenario, and can propose better prototypes that fit the scenarios provided.

	"Using examples (such as inputs and desired outputs) to specify a product has been helpful for 	many years, but the explosion of possible AI applications is creating a need for more product 	managers to learn this practice."-Andrew NG 

Example:
If someone request "a vision system to detect pedestrians outside our store" it is to vague. But if a PM collects a handful of pictures and notates them with the desire output, the meaning "detect pedestrian" becomes concrete.

## 2. Asses technical feasibility of LLM-based applications by prompting.
PMs can prompt LLM to see if an idea is feasible without the need of some software engineer to help them to check. When the PM arrives with a feasible idea with the SW Engineers. PMs can do basic feasibility at a basic level, than before. 
Andrew NG has the better Python course for AI (recommended for a friend that took several python courses to learn). It is on my list of things to do in 2025. You can find it in the following link https://tinyurl.com/2jc7r4eb 


## 3. Prototype and test without engineers.
There are several AI tools, that NG recommends: Replit, Vercels, V0, Bolt, and Anthropic's Artifacts. These tools allow OT technical users to create prototypes, some coding can helps a lot. Technical, and not technical users use it to:
- prototype
- get user feedback
- iterate quickly

A final though from Andrew NG, implicitly says that Product Management is a useful and evolving discipline "I find this discipline fascinating, and will keep on sharing best practices as they grow and evolve.". 

Who is Andrew NG?
Andrew NG is a computer scientists and tech entrepreneur focusing in Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. He is cofounder of Google Brain, former Chief Scientists at Bauidu, associate professor of the Stanford AIL Lab, and cofounding Coursera, and DeepLearning.AI. His goal is to democratize deep learning teaching over 8 million students through his online courses!!!! 
Alex, Karina, Arturo, among other created the Data Gallos 8 years before. Their objective was to acquire Data Science skills. Since then, they follow Andrew NG, and their opinions carefully. Andrew is a great educator. Alex, you can write a story about it...

## My third PhD trial. Artificial Intelligence, and Product Management
As I said, this is my third intent to study the PhD. I had not success with the first two. I will add a post with the three previous thesis proposals later. Meanwhile, lets talk about the third intent... 

### 3.1 AI aided Sw Development
The general hypothesis was that AI will create super developers that will thrive in the AI-Software world. Those who uses complex machines and algorithms, will thrive (I am referring to Cal Newport advice in Deep Work). 
The name for the proposal was "AI aided Sw Development".
How a common outdated sw engineer, could perform as a professional sw developer using artificial intelligence tools, like chatgpt, GitHub copilot, amazon whisperer, among others...
How a professional sw developer could increase his productivity by 10x using the same AI tools...
How a professional sw developer could perform as a small sw team...
The thesis Committee accepted my proposal, but during the first year I changed my mind... Some factors influenced me to take such decision...
1. The topic was proposed by me. 
2. My thesis director had no much time for me.
3. My thesis codirector was not interested.
4. I started to think about some topic aligned between my thesis directors, and me.

## 3.2 All start with a Problem. Solutions Strategies suggested by AI to Daily PM problems
Everything started with the article from springer about the common problems that face Product Managers. It is a well written academic article. I liked the form, and the content. Since I performed as a Software Product Manager for two years, and my Thesis Co-Director did it to, I proposed this new topic. What could be the solutions for that problems from the point of view of experts (the teachers, not the students).

I linked the Product Manager's problems, and AI with the concept. "Learn from the teachers, not from the students". So I wanted to know what great teachers thinks about the Daily Product Managers Problems. Who are the great teachers? Well, the world topic experts, and authors of books. Those who all the PMs follow in order to learn good practices.

A disadvantage is that they are not easy to reach (this is an assumption). Why not ask AI, as if AI represent the thought of theses experts. Voila! 



I studied previously, how to build prompts, and I know that you can ask an LLM like CHATgtp to think like a specific Great Teacher, ask them a questions, and specify the format of the output. This is a basic pattern of Prompt Engineering.


So, my next attempt was related to Product Management, and Artificial Intelligence. The topic that Andrew NG things is a good one. Why did I follow this path? I am interested in AI, because I thing its changing every aspect of human life. Why Product managers would be out of this trend? The use of Artificial Intelligence is relatively new.

## Yes but, Springer solved that. She found the solutions strategies suggested by PMs.
A second article of springer proposed solution strategies to common problems.
The data from both articles come from Product Managers with Experience. Both common problems, and common solutions. Well, it was normal that a Product Management group will continue researching. They found a gold vein. They are mining it.

The second article of Springer is a base line. 

So I Proposed to create digital twins of experts in product management (the teachers), and not from the students (the product managers with experience). My idea was firs to create a "Customized Chatbot feed with the public information of Product Management experts (blogposts, youtube videos, etc.)" to ask them about solution strategies.

A second approach, is to provide the problems to a LLM, like ChatGPT, and obtain the answers.
I had two main questions. If I arrive to the same conclusions that PM with experience, it is not necessary to make studies, it is faster to do it with artificial intelligence.
Some results will be identical, some results different. From the different results
A third scenario is a customized

Fall in love with the problem, not with your solution
