# Creating Software AI Products, the AI Product Management Way.
By Pepe Hernandez. December 13th, 2024

## A new hope for my thesis topic

Today Alex came at 5.00 with a WhatsApp message: Look at this post, Andrew NG thinks that your thesis theme is good: Product Management with AI.

Andrew NG! What did he said? I said outloud. While I have been studying the PhD, I have had several doubts about my topic. In fact I, since the first intent, I have  tried with five different topics. 

I open the blog post from Andrew NG and, and start reading. When Alex recommend something, I am 99% sure the recommendation is good.

-------------------

## Andrew NG thinks AI is enabling Product Managers to make a better job

In his recent blogpost, Andrew NG talks about new patters in the Product Management discipline due to the enabling AI tools. He refers to the AI Product opportunities. The tool is an AI tool, the product is an AI product. This change of the market, and the change of the tools enables new practices.

NG asserts that "AI Product Management is evolving."

	"The growth of generative AI and AI-based developer tools has created numerous opportunities 	to build new kinds of things, among them AI applications". 

This new way of creating things is driving shifts in best practices in Product Management, because WAHT IS POSSIBLE TO BUILT has shifted. 

Note. I like the definition of Andrew NG (Product Management is the discipline of defining what to build to serve users).

### 1. Use concrete examples to specify AI products.

When a requirement is vague, and general, Artificial Intelligence can generate anything. To have better results, we need to be more specific. By providing examples or scenarios, AI can generate something that includes the based scenarios. The more scenarios, the better the outcome of AI tools. 

Note. By the way, last week Alejandro GarcÃ­a wrote about how examples, or scenarios are the base of TDD (Test Driven Development), and how Bertrand Meyer is skeptic about them. Bertrand Meyer prefers a formal specification (Design By Contract). Alex reflects about this two points of view, and arrive to the specific cases where each of them is a better approach, including when to use both at the same time. Check the blogpost here -> https://jagcoop.github.io/posts/tdd_cloud_wilkinson_vs_meyer/ 

A PM can literally take pictures, and write notes about what is happening. The AI can identify the scenario, and can propose better prototypes that fit the scenarios provided.

	"Using examples (such as inputs and desired outputs) to specify a product has been helpful for 	many years, but the explosion of possible AI applications is creating a need for more product 	managers to learn this practice."-Andrew NG 

Example:
If someone request "a vision system to detect pedestrians outside our store" it is to vague. But if a PM collects a handful of pictures and make some notes on it with the desire output, the meaning "detect pedestrian" becomes more concrete.

### 2. Asses technical feasibility of LLM-based applications by prompting.
PMs can prompt LLM to see if an idea is feasible without the need of some software engineer to help them to check. When the PM arrives with a feasible idea with the SW Engineers. PMs can do basic feasibility at a basic level, than before. 

By the way, Andrew NG has the better Python course for AI (recommended from Nohemi. She has taken  several python courses to learn, and she thingks this is bthe best). It is on my list of things to do in 2025. You can find it in the following link https://tinyurl.com/2jc7r4eb 


### 3. Prototype and test without engineers.
There are several AI tools, that NG recommends: Replit, Vercels, V0, Bolt, and Anthropic's Artifacts. These tools allow OT technical users to create prototypes, some coding can helps a lot. Technical, and not technical users use it to:
- prototype
- get user feedback
- iterate quickly

A final though from Andrew NG, implicitly says that Product Management is a useful and evolving discipline "I find this discipline fascinating, and will keep on sharing best practices as they grow and evolve.". 

### Who is Andrew NG?
Andrew NG is a computer scientists and tech entrepreneur focusing in Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. He is cofounder of Google Brain, former Chief Scientists at Bauidu, associate professor of the Stanford AIL Lab, and cofounding Coursera, and DeepLearning.AI. His goal is to democratize deep learning teaching over 8 million students through his online courses!!!! 
Alex, Karina, Arturo, among other created the Data Gallos 8 years before. Their objective was to acquire Data Science skills. Since then, they follow Andrew NG, and their opinions carefully. Andrew is a great educator. Alex, you can write a story about it...

-----------------------

## My third PhD trial. Artificial Intelligence, and Product Management
As I said, this is my third intent to study the PhD. I had not success with the first two. I will add a post with the three previous thesis proposals later. Meanwhile, lets talk about the third intent... 

### 3.1 AI aided Sw Development
The general hypothesis was that AI will create super developers that will thrive in the AI-Software world. Those who uses complex machines and algorithms, will thrive (I am referring to Cal Newport advice in Deep Work). My proposal is related to the use of AI for increasing my abilities as Sw Developer. The name for the proposal was "AI aided Sw Development".
The proposal tried to answer the questions
- "How a common outdated sw engineer, could perform as a professional sw developer using artificial intelligence tools, like chatgpt, GitHub copilot, amazon whisperer, among others...
- How a professional sw developer could increase his productivity by 10x using the same AI tools...
- How a professional sw developer could perform as a small sw team...

The thesis Committee accepted my proposal, but during the first year I changed my mind... Some factors influenced me to take such decision...
1. The topic was proposed by me. 
2. My thesis director had no much time for me.
3. My thesis codirector was not interested in the topic.
4. I started to think about some topic aligned with my thesis directors, and me.

So I deferred the commitment, and thought about what could be a good topic. I asked Alex again. Alex asked me "Wasn't there a single PhD-worthy problem that you, and Perla faced while worked in Kueski?". 

As a Product Manager I had many problems... I thought it could be a good idea. 

### 3.2 A common topic Product Managers Problems 
So I came back with my thesis co-Director, Perla Velasco, and expose the question of Alex.
Perla, and I thought. What problems did we face in Kueski as Product Managers? I previously asked a pair of PMs and Software Engineering Managers. The answer were not satisfactory. 

Perla, had recommemnded to me an article a pair of months ago, about problems faced by PMs. It was published on the Empirical Software Engineering. It is a well written academic article. I liked the form, and the content. Since both of us were colleagues in a Fintech for two years, both performing Product Manager roles, this was the common theme we were looking for.At the end of the article, identifies solutuions strategies as a subsecuent work for her team. Look for the solutions to those problems could be a good idea. 

I linked the Product Manager's problems, and AI with the concept. "Learn from the teachers, not from the students". So I wanted to know what great teachers thinks about the Daily Product Managers Problems. Who are the great teachers? Well, the world topic experts, and authors of books. Those who all the PMs follow in order to learn good practices. A clear disadvantage is that experts are not easy to reach (this is an assumption). Why not ask AI, as if AI represent the thought of theses experts. Voila! 

I studied previously, how to build prompts, and I know that you can ask an LLM like CHATgtp to think like a specific Great Teacher, ask them a questions, and specify the format of the output. This is a basic pattern of Prompt Engineering... While I was writing the new thesis proposal, I found that Springer had writen an second article "Strategies for Dealing With Software Product Management Challenges". There Springer got solutions strategies provided by Product Mangers with experience for the top 5 problemas of her previous article. 

The good news were that I had a base line, the problems on one side, and the solution strategies on the other side.  

I need to refine the idea, the specific terms to look for, and the proposal. 

### 3.3 Finding the right concepts for my proposal
I came to Alex again, how would you name an AI fed with the public knowledge of experts? 
Alex told me, it could be Artificial Intelligence Agent, or Digital Twins. At the end of summer I had the name for my proposal "Solution strategies generated by Artificial Intelligence Agents to common problems in Software Product Management."

I had a review from my thesis Director, and co-Director. They accepted the proposal, but questioned in order to refine the idea:
- What would answer an Artificial Intelligence Agent to my question. What answer are alike, what are different, and what is the rationale for each answer.
- Choose a small scope. Focus only on five problems. 

They also set a deadline for a Systematic Literature Review. I still working on it. It will be a topic for another post...

#### A direct experiment with CHATGPT. Whad CHATGPT answer to the promt "What are the top 10 solution strategies, for the top 5 problems detected on the article of Springer?"
I jump directly to a "customized LLM" with knowledbe of a specific expert. But, general LLMs Agent ask to prompts without needing some feedback. Perla told me, why you dont ask directly to LLMs and verify if the solution strategies to common problems are the same. 

I did it. Some answers are the same, most of them. And somee are different. There are two cases with the different ones. First, solutions strategies proposed by Product Managers that were not metioned by LLM Agent (for this case CHATGPT version 4.0). Second case, the solutions strategis proposed by ChatGPT, and not metioned by Product Managers with experience. A third questions arises, what is the rationale behind each solution strategy in each case?

My thesis proposal focus on an experiment (an output), not an outcome (a solution). Is there a need for the output. Is it the output what is needed? It is better than other options? Which other options do you have? Have someone worked on this problem? Is it an important problem? 

Well, Andrew NG thinks the theme/problem is right. 

### 3.4 AI tools that supports Product Management practices
In Academic Research you need to know what others said about your idea. "Nothing is new under the sun", said the Ecleasiastes. So, I looked for customized LLMs as a first approach, then i complement with tailored AI agents, then passed to domain specific. One of my proffesors said that we need to clarifly what is, and what is not. At the end we generalize to AI tools that support Product Management.

I design an experiment to map this three options. I could get product management practices from experts. But then a philosophical questinos arises. 


### 3.5 Is not about gathering information, is about developing skills.

---------------------------
A philosophical Question. The problem is not to identify a good practice, but really develope expertise on the practice.

Perla said, I think the problem is not the information gathering.
If you build your prompt right, then you will get an acceptable answer.
We teach students Software Engineering good practices. And they build crappy software. 
How can a PM develope expertise?

I thought, the problem is that students of Softwre Engineering have limited practice during college. If they build some kind of software or solution, it will be the first one. 
One thing is to know something, another thing is to really understand it, and other thing is to dominate the practice at a proeficient level.
Knowing wicha are the goood practices for a software product manager is no enough to help them dominate the practices.

Then, our research questions refined. Is there some AI toos that supports knowing, understanding, and developing product management practices?

I found none yet. If I look for AI tools that supports acquiring software product management practices you dont find any article.

Ok, I though, lets go with a wider scope. 

AI tools that support product management practices, as the main questions for the literature review. And then the questions about knowing, understtading and develop skill on a specific practices.

Now, I am at that poing. I will continue writing about it.


-----------
Resume
The AI topic como from the power of digital tools mastered of guided by humans.
The Product Manager problems, comes from the shared experience of being a PM at a Fintch.
The creating of the digital twin, or a customized exepert come from two ideas of Alex.
- Follow the teachers, not the students
Ellaborating a good prompt, will get a good answer solutions strategies for daily productm management problems.
We can do a comparision between both of them. This can be a good article.
Creating a customized, tailored, domain specific, AI agent, or digital twin
The CHATBOT is the most popular way to interact with a LLM. 
If there is a gap on the learning of skills for knowledge domain, what alternatives can you use that could take advantage of AI, to allow Software Product Managers to develop expertise.

----------
What is next?
* Finish the Protocol
* Finishing the SLR
* Detect from 1 to 3 possibles journals that could evaluate the SLR
* Refine it until it is published
